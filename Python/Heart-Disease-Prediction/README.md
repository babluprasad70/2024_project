# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
### Overview:
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health parameters using machine learning techniques. Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making early detection crucial for effective prevention and treatment. This predictive model leverages data analysis and machine learning algorithms to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing patients at risk.

### Objectives:
- To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the presence of heart disease.
- To analyze key health metrics and identify factors contributing to heart disease risk.
- To visualize data and prediction outcomes for better interpretability.
### Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: Python
 #### Libraries:
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - NumPy for numerical calculations
  - Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
  - Plotly for interactive graphs
  - Jupyter Notebook for developing and documenting the project.
### Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data), containing various attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The data is preprocessed to ensure quality and suitability for analysis.

### Model Development:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns and correlations.
- Feature selection to identify the most relevant attributes affecting heart disease risk.
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to evaluate model performance.
- Hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy.
### Results:
The model achieved an accuracy of 90.81% on the validation dataset. Visualizations of the results provide insights into the modelâ€™s predictive capabilities and the significance of different health metrics.

### Conclusion
