"Very accomodating of our party, including our 7 month old baby. Friendly server. Modern, luxe decor, lots of space. Food good if portions quite small.",2
Very good service and good food. Restaurant was hopping.,2
"We booked a table for dinner, to celebrate a friendâs birthday. The place was packed and service was a little bit slow. We ordered our main course, we then asked for a dessert menu, the waitress left it and disappeared for 20 minutes. When she returned she told us we couldnât order our dessert because the kitchen was closed. I was really disappointed, they knew we had to get a dessert and have a candle to celebrate the birthday. 

Overall the place was crowded,  noisy and service really slow. Food was okay nothing special, we had ordered mash and vegetables and we were told there was no mash and veg left and forced to have garlic fries instead.
Very disappointed!",1
We had an amazing two night stay. From receptionist to bedrooms to Sophies and the Elephant castle all were top class. One of the nicest stays we have had anywhere in the longest time. Already planning our next stay can't wait. We want the give a huge shout out to Fiona in Sophies she was absolutely amazing . Always in great fun form and nothing was to much for her . Simply amazing. But all staff were 100% but she stood out to us. Thank you again everyone ye are amazing bunch of people who love their jobs xxx,2
Such a fun place for dinner and drinks on St Patrickâs day. Food was absolutely delicious. Service was lovely. Cocktails fun. Beautiful view.,2
"I have to say I was disappointed with the menu having been there several times before. I brought my (aged) parents for a St Patrick's weekend treat and only having a bunch menu at 2.30pm in the afternoon with only one non-breakfast choice ( the chicken burger, apart from pizza's ) was very limiting and really disappointing. II know I should have checked in advance but having been therefore socially and on work nights I naively  assumed the menu would be equally as varied.  Still made the most of it and they enjoyed the experience",0
The environment was spacious and exquisite!!! What a charm and the food was grand!!! Although I do believe they should remove the ham wrapped purple cauliflower from the menuâ¦. Otherwise it was a delight!!!!,2
"The view is  amazing on 2 sides depending on where you are sitting A pity terrace doesnât go all the way round.
Staff dressed very casually despite dress code for customers.Staff were certainly courteous and friendly.
Food was average Caesar salad had fatty bacon with a lot of lettuce Pork belly a lot of fat also Main courses very small with little vegetable.
CrÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e was cold. Men in my group were not happy after 3 courses. Food was poor value for money. I know now why it was only place available for Mothers Day",0
"Drinks, food and service all good.  I didn't like that the tables are on top of each other. It makes it very awkward when sitting beside other couples.",2
My two friends and I had a lovely Saturday brunch at Sophieâs. The food was delicious and the service was great. The restaurant was busy enough to provide a nice atmosphere and we especially enjoyed the beautiful view. We all agreed that we would definitely return and would love to try out the evening menu.,2
I wasnât happy with the pizza I got as it was sopping wet and very doughy,0
It was a busy time and service was slow as a result. Staff were lovely though and the food and atmosphere was nice.,1
"Overall a wonderful experience, butâ¦
1. Poor/no gluten free options  
2. Birthday message on dessert was forgotten &
3. Crispy bacon for breakfast was not crispy.",2
"A+ for ambiance. The restaurant is beautiful inside with a fantastic view of Galway.
The food was good. With a decent cocktail and wine selection. I think they must have been short staffed - with two people taking care of the whole place.",1
"Slay, just absolutely slay, slayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy",2
Music was very loud at our table. It was turned down and we were told that was the lowest it could go which was still too loud. Ordered 2 wines which were out of stock. Picked a 3rd and when we ordered a second bottle after our starter it did not come until we were already eating the mains. Ordered seafood spaghetti and the mussels had not opened and so unsafe to eat. I mentioned to the wait staff who said they would tell the kitchen but nothing further was said. One persons dessert out of 6 was forgotten. Food overall was really bland and disappointing. Style over substance,0
"Food and service was excellent. Asked for one of there best tables to celebrate wedding anniversary, and they did not let us down. Very good experience.",2
Service was very disappointing. It was busy to be fair but not exceptionally busy.,1
"Overall very nice experience in beautiful place, great service but seafood linguine tasted more like a baby food, cold pasta with plain tomato sauce and very few prawns and mussels really disappointed me, never eat anything worst than that ð¢ my husband had calzone and it was really nice, beautiful cocktails .",0
Food was nice. Service overall was very poor. Chips came after the mains as there was a delay with the kitchen. We didn't have time to order desert as the table was needed back and barely able to get a coffee. Won't be back,1
Great venue fantastic service would happily return!,2
"We booked this meal as a special night out with a friend visiting from abroad. Unfortunately it didn't live up to our expectations or matched our previous visit. Service was lacklustre. Our main server seems disinterested. No ""hi, how are you"", just perfunctory. Slouched against the wall when taking our order. No lamb available which wasn't mentioned when menus were given leaving two of our party disappointed. No drinks menu given, no salt/pepper on the table, no cooler for bottle of wine. No one checked on us during our meal. The lady who served the food was a breath of fresh air, cheerful and friendly. Food was ok. Risotto needed more depth of flavour and some fresh black pepper. Definately overpriced. Pizza was tasty. Love the room, good atmosphere but unfortunately we won't be rushing back.",0
"It was a very nice lunch we had.
And the view is outstanding.
Highly Recommended",2
Met by friendly staff when we got there but then had to ask for our drinks having ordered them when we sat down. We then waited an hour for our mains to come out having had no starters - not even a basket of bread to keep us going. They did acknowledge this and took 2 drinks off our overall bill. Staff did their best but it's not very well run. Nobody seems to be overseeing what's going on.,2
"It was my first experience, i loved it, so beautiful and pretty sure k will ne back in the summer time, good service just from the moment i arrived to the waitress , keep it up guys",2
Enjoyed just need to change menu .. as in more options for starters and mains,2
Highly recommend. The only thing I could fault was we were sitting very close to other guests.,2
"Unfortunately a disappointing experience. The quality of the food wasnât great and despite specifically asking for hard fried eggs, they were the exact opposite",0
"Had a fabulous meal, super service, tasty food and great atmosphere",2
"Really good place for a gathering with friends/coworkers or a date night where you want to impress t that special one!!!
Definitely recommend it!!",2
We had a very enjoyable dinner in Sophies. Good menu selection to suit everyone's palate and modern decor. Service was very good.,2
"Food and drink extremely overpriced for what we got, nothing out of the ordinary. Restaurant and hotel decor was fabulous, very trendy vibe and can see money was well spent but food wise Iâve had better and for much better price.",0
"Cold.
 Dj not great at all.
Waitress lovely and friendly.",2
"Super friendly staff. We felt well looked after.
There is a lovely atmosphere in the place.",2
Requested flowers didnât have any. Food was nice but expensive,2
"We ordered pizzas which were soggy and the chips had seen better days! Desert was amazing and the atmosphere is great. Staff were lovely and the restaurant is beautiful, Will probably be back!",0
"Diavola pizza is fab, setting is great, wine is great",2
"Our experience was amazing, food, drink and service were second to none. Looking forward to returning.",2
"Great spot, lovely food, great service and good atmosphere",2
"The steak was burnt, served with fries and arugula, not worth the price.",2
"Steaks perfectly cooked, chicken was phenomenally prepared moist and tender.
Cocktails were consistent and really nice, hit the spot.

Music levels can drown out conversation across the table",2
Food was fine . Nothing special for the price . The portion of chips we ordered were undercooked .   Staff were lovely and friendly and service very good .,1
The food was great and staff were lovely - I canât remember the name of the young girl who served us but she could not have been more accommodating!,2
"Lovely food ,lovely staff and  lovely evening had.",2
"This was a pleasant experience but I have a real problem with the drinks menu. As a recovering alcoholic I was pleased to see a selection of non-alcoholic cocktails on the menu. However, it tasted of alcohol when it arrived. I asked our waitress only to be told that there was 0.0 gin in my cocktail. This was not included on the contents list on the menu. This was OK by me but would pose a serious problem with some of my fellow addicts. This could easily be the trigger that causes a relapse. This is completely unacceptable.",2
Was lovely and relaxing with lovely staff and amazing  food,2
"My husbands starter, scallops were underdone slightly. And the steak wasnât the best quality, when you are paying so much for it. 
I really enjoyed my soup and supreme chicken and would recommend, first time there, would go back to give another try but not for a good while. The interiors are amazing and really worth seeing.",1
Menu was quite limited. There were no deserts available for coeliacs and limited options for starters/mains.,1
Absolutely fabulous evening in Sophiaâs restaurant on 1.1.2024 . The staff were superb . Food delish . Highly recommend and will definitely be back . Thank you,2
"Lovely Brunch this afternoon. Thanks to Amelia for looking after a birthday plate for my daughter.

Will be back soon",2
"We had booked for New Yearâs Eve as an early seating at 6:30 and ordered two pizzas and two sides to share and was told it was policy to order 1 main course per person. From this point on the service was awful, the staff was so rude and it was an extremely uncomfortable experience.",1
"Really enjoyed our dinner at Sophieâs. The food was incredible from start to finish. I had the pork belly to start, cod for main and brownie for dessert. Service was very good and very prompt. There is also a really nice atmosphere there, the decor is cool. Only downside was that we were sat at a lovely table in the corner beside the window and it was really cold and drafty!",2
"Fantastic Brunch!! Great service, will be back again.",2
"OK experience, maybe the view is worth it. Disappointed with food and menu",1
"Gorgeous food, great service and wonderful atmosphere. The waiter at the desk was very helpful and was very kind to take many photos of us on the swings outside the restaurant. A fantastic experience overall.",2
"Terrible food and super overpriced !
I wouldnât recommend to anyone really!",0
"When we arrived at Sophieâs there was a very reduced menu. They were not serving pizzas, prawns and pasta. The service was very slow.",0
Was looking forward to brunch but only on sat and Sundays â¦ lunch menu was bit expensive,2
"Everything was great,  will come back for sure .Highly recommend it",2
"Beautiful food with excellent service, loved everything about this restaurant",2
Great food and the waitress was so polite and helpful,2
"Stayed at The Dean with my family and we ate in Sophieâs. It has the whole package, great food, excellent service, great atmosphere. Itâs a 3-hr drive for us but we will definitely return again! Definitely recommend everyone to go to Sophieâs.",2
Although the restaurant was quiet when we arrived it was 20 minutes before anyone came to take our order. There appeared to be plenty of staff wandering around doing nothing. When our order was taken it was also very slow coming. The food was very good and we enjoyed our meal and the ambiance. Just a pity about the service,2
Staff were excellent. Food was delicious. Excellent enviroment,2
"Very friendly staff. Great ambience, tasty food. Cocktails could be improved / quality better- no passion fruit slice on passion fruit martini and was very watery. Flat Prosecco with it. (Didnât bother saying it as staff were fabulous and service was excellent overall - mains and starters fab/ steaks cooked to perfection , sticky toffee pudding was cold apart from the sauce on top and was a little stale. Sauce on it was delicious though! Really enjoyed our meal! Elephant and castle for breakfast in morning was also lovely. Again staff are excellent. Thanks :-)",2
"Food was a disaster !
Both lamb and steak were cold and potatoe garnish not cooked and tasteless had to send back ordered more starters. Not tasty at all service was slow but staff were ok  
Very disappointing bringing staff to Christmas party and too expensive for the quality of food and drink.
Overall very poor",0
Will definitely be back again soon! Really enjoyable!,2
"The place is lovely. However, the food was just right. Not plentiful and quite salty. Maybe we'll come back for cocktails but I don't think we'll be back for dinner",0
Fabulous food and lovely staff and pleasantly surprised with the price.,2
"Had dinner menu, on Thursday night. Fantastic atmosphere and well organised.
Food was of a premium standard, at a good price point. 
I would and have recommended Sophies based on my positive experiences.",2
"Excellent all-round to be fair, can't fault anything",2
Food terrible and so expensive for what it is.  Only saving grace is the ambiance,0
"Food excellent, great atmosphere, highly recommended.",2
"3 steaks & one chicken dish, food would have been gorgeous if it was served hot, it was nearly cold",0
Great service. We were really well looked after by Suzanna who ensured that my gluten free meal was just that. Would like to see a better selection of gluten free options.,2
"Such a lovely evening, food, wine, service was so good. We didnât catch his name but we had the most lovely and attentive server. 
Food was flavoursome and so tasty. We will definitely be back",2
Lovely atmosphere and ambiance for a Christmas  get together. Staff friendly and helpful.,2
"Sophies@The Dean is a lovely venue, positive friendly staff but the mains are over priced for what they contain.",1
"The staff in Sophieâs were so helpful, Rita and Hannah both served us and were great. Food was tasty, cocktails were delicious. Would highly recommend",2
Food is good but overpriced. I got the chicken supreme (â¬25) and it only came with broccoli there was no side of potato. For the price id expect to get a full meal. Otherwise the staff were friendly and the restaurant itself is modern and has good views of the city.,1
"Limited choice, no specials and the lamb was off the menu. The steak was 8oz, instead of 10oz on menu. But we were still charged the full price. Cocktails were pricey and were only so so. Avoid if you can!",1
"Had a lovely meal with my aunt and my sister, Bernardo was so friendly and very attentive. The food was tasty and staff were so lovely.",2
"Disappointing.  Sophie's does not deliver what it promises. This is not a 'first time' bad day, but a repeated poor experience. The waiting staff are bravely holding together a shoddy effort of a restaurant",0
Brilliant experience overall for my fiancÃ©âs birthday,2
Really enjoyed our stay in Dean Hotel and experience in Sophie.. But was disappointed in my striplion steak! I had to ask for 2 different steak knives and still couldn't cut it! Dissapointed it was so chewey! But will be bk again!! ð,2
"Portion size vs price was insane.
Order two chicken supremes and both got scabby portions. 
Tables on either side of us also had issue with portion sizes of their dishes.
For reference, the brownie we ordered for dessert was bigger than the piece of chicken we were served.",0
Food was very good and the vibes were really nice,2
"Stunning place. Very beautiful and food was 10 out of 10. Staff very attentive and polite. We are coming back here again with the girls for Christmas party and some other day for family dinner. 
Who ever was rating food to 1 star they really don't know what they are talking about.",2
Unbelievable food and the service was even better couldnât fault it one bit a lovely place,2
Amazing meal our servers were so nice and helpful. We ordered 2 pizzas and a cocktail. Really busy for a Friday evening but will definitely recommend !,2
"Food and service were very good, next time I might book to come later as there wasnât much of an atmosphere at 6:30-7:30.",2
"Lovely to pop into Sophieâs as usual, however the afternoon was left on a sore point:

My daughter ordered a plate of brown bread which never arrived even though the restaurant was really quiet and only 3 times occupies at the time we were there. I didnât flag the brown bread not arriving as I couldnât be bothered asking if they had forgotten. The waitress who took our order never came over to check if everything was ok so o didnât have an opportunity to speak up there either.

Once Iâd fined my meal I went over to pay but didnât realize until I got to the car that the brown bread we were not provided was indeed included on the bill.

I know these things happen so itâs no big deal but especially on a slow day, youâd think there would be extra care in customer service as the easy atmosphere allowed for it?

Hoping better will be done next time and Iâll also be sure to review the bill thoroughly before paying!",1
"Itâs our second time at Sophieâs and we brought friends with us this time. The restaurant is great and the view (although it was dark already) is amazing. Staff were polite and attentive. The food was good, one thing I would say is that my wifeâs gnocchi could have bit more veg in it but this is a personal preference. Deserts were nice and wine was lovely. We are highly recommending this experience in a lovely and friendly restaurant.",2
Food standard has dropped since my last visit. Ordered beef croquettes and there was very little beef in them. Risotto was nice but dry. The white chocolate and raspberry cheesecake had zero white chocolate anywhere. Just plain raspberry cheesecake and I requested a happy birthday writing on the plate on of the dessert for my girlfriend which did not happen. This disappointed me. We were informed that there was a new chef and unfortunately this was very evident,0
"Had a nice evening in Sophie food and service were good ,I'm a bit old school so would like to see the waiting staff a bit more smartly dressed",2
Good place to have a nice dinner. First time here and I was very impressed,2
"Great food, great service and the happy birthday touch was appreciated!",2
"Staff were fantastic, friendly helpful with great recommendations. Food was delicious and ambience was fantastic.",2
Lovely setting and staff. Pizza was fine but desserts were of a lower standard,1
Short menu but still with a good range of choices.  We opted for pizzas which were delivered to our table by the friendly chef. Would have liked a wider choice of sines available by the glass.,2
"Came here for dinner on a trip to Galway, food was absolutely gorgeous ! The decor and atmosphere was just beautiful",2
"Sophieâs was one of our top favorite restaurants in Galway!!

Food was incredible!",2
Lovely evening. Staff were friendly and attentive. Food was superb,2
"Service was excellent. 
Maria served us and she was lovely and very professional.
Portions were small. 
Desert was very disappointing. 
The surroundings and atmosphere were perfect.",1
"The service was very good, I had prawn main Foch very tasty, needed side dish with it. The white Newzeland wine was very good.",2
So disappointing .. I emailed in advance to say it was my daughterâs birthday and could they arrange a candle etc .. service was slow and a pint that was ordered never reached the table . The food portions were small and lacked flavour would have to say it was the worst food Iâve had and so overpriced .. the birthday surprise didnât happen because the waiter came to the table twice to ask who the birthday was for .. in front of everyone .. such a let down ..if youâre paying big money you expect top service .. and just as a last point the staff are very sloppily dressed .. not what you expect to see in âtopâ restaurant,0
Great vibe! Drinks were great! Hannah our server was incredible!!,2
"Gorgeous Food, fabulous ambience & also a DJ playing music not too loudly but it was a beautiful experience",2
Lovely place to eat. Really good views of the city and the food was really good,2
"The place is absolutely stunning with a gorgeous view of the city, spotlessly clean and comfortable. Food was very tasty and the portions were generous. The staff is amazing a d they go above and beyond to make your dinning experience perfect. I would absolutely recommend this place.",2
Very good food with amazing service. Really recommend going at night time or when itâs dark to also enjoy the view outside,2
Fantastic athmosphere. NYC comes to Galway. Well worth a visit,1
"Sophieâs rooftop restaurant was amazing, I had the risotto started it was amazing, then cod also delicious, well worth it, Iâll be back again.",2
A gorgeous view with great vibe and good food! Thoroughly enjoyed our meal here!,2
Staff was tremendous.Adrianne I believe was her name,2
The food was what let you down. I got ceasar salad with limp lettuce and no parmesan. No seasoning at all on the chicken.  Pretty poor effort.,0
The food and service were very good. Food was good quality and of a good standard. My friends felt that their portion sizes were on the small side. Overall a positive experience but we all agreed that the starters and desserts were on the expensive side .,2
"Was a lovely relaxing start to the morning, and they catered for my meal choices with no issue or hesitation",2
Food and cocktails were great !! Staff were so friendly,2
"The food was nice, some portions were small. I have to admit, the fish was absolutely delicious. Service was also great.",2
We had an amazing meal here last night.  Service was excellent and all 4 dinners were incredible.  Hope to be back soon.  Highly recommend this lovely restaurant.,2
"Service was poor. All of our order was not put through, which delayed some food. Ordered a bottle of wine (waitress double checked with me that it was a bottle for three people) someone else then arrived down with a glass. 
Ordered cocktails after dinner and was 25mins waiting for them. 
Food was lovely but service was very disappointing",2
Wonderful  restaurant and staff.  The food was the best we have ever had from the cod to the chicken just outstanding,2
"The poor service ruined our evening. No member of staff came near our table once our food was delivered. 40 mins after we finished eating, i beckoned a staff member to clear our places. There were dirty tables all around us that had been vacated, staff were not over busy, yet they did not clear the tables. Bottle of cleaning spray and cloth was left at table next to us for over half hour, people at other side of us had to order drinks twice before they got them,  no sign of any manager or staff getting direction from anyone. Seemed very inexperienced.",1
"Food was very good, although not much choice,  service was extremely slow,  when we asked for more drinks/condiments we were forgotten and had to re ask,  not once did anyone come to the table so we could order extra drinks.  We were only served on arrival",1
Lunch was very basic food choices done really well. Be warned that portions are small so sides are needed. Our meal took an age to arrive even though the restaurant was very quiet but staff were friendly and efficient.,2
"Great views from restaurant and can sit outside and enjoy a cocktail 

Went with 2 children at 530 and no childrenâs options at all 

My main course  â¬30 steak was  nice but tiny portions and I was hungry afterwards

I wouldnât rush back or recommend anyone to go for the food but worth a visit to have a drink",0
"We had a lovely meal with a nice bottle of Italian Wine. Our waiter, Bernardo, was excellent and very knowledgable about both food & drink. Duck was a little on tough side and seafood pasta dish was excessively tomatoey. Sunset & views were spectacular. Not as good as Laylaâs in Ranelagh.",2
"Zussana was our waitress and very quick to get us anything we needed. She also was very visibly busy but took the extra steps to make sure we were enjoying everything about our meal.

The food was great and the view during dinner was a beautiful Galway sunset.",2
"Fantastic, polite and friendly service. Food was beautifully presented and absolutely delicious.",2
Everything perfect except for the sad dead palm trees on the balcony.which incidentally can be seen on the approach from the Dublin road. Not a good look.,2
"Really enjoyed our meal here for our friends going away, the staff made it special for us aswell by giving her a glass of Prosecco. Would definitely recommend",2
Food was lovely. Staff great and the view was wonderful,2
"The staff wasnât friendly at all, the dinner menu is really poor there are not many options

The place is beautiful and the ambiance is nice",1
I have to say that my girlfriends duck was very tough and dry and should of came with a side dish without having to order one separately.,0
Brought my mother for dinner there as I had being 3 times before so knew it was a nice place to go,2
Loved it and will be back again for sure as soon as I can,2
Food was absolutely delicious. Fun and friendly staff. Beautiful dining room and great views of Galway.,2
Fantastic service and great food. Very accommodating and very much added to overall enjoyment of the night. Would highly recommend.,2
"I had the cod it was lovely , anther guest had the steak and she thought it was tough and overpriced for what she got. 
We had a gorgeous waitress , Suzana. She was excellent.",1
"Food was decent but possibly the worst service that Iâve ever had in my life (and Iâm over 70). The server came to get our order and thatâs the last we ever saw of him. The table next to us come 20-30 minutes after us, but received their meal well ahead of us. The noise level is best suited for a rock concert.",1
"Both food and service were fab, will definitely be back",2
"We really enjoyed the Dean and the roof top restaurant.Service was brilliant,ambience fabulous.Would definately go again.Great location.",2
"We booked here for a celebration, the vibe and atmosphere was great, the service was excellent, we all loved the starters, our mains were also great, the only thing I would say is that you need to order sides with your mains as they don't come with much,
Overall, we would recommend Sophies as our group of 4 all had a great meal there,",2
"We ordered some cocktails to start which were  nice and well presented however we were quite disappointed with the quality of the food we received. We ordered the croquettes to share. Which were nice and well cooked giving us the impression the rest would match the same quality.
However when we received our mains the linguine I received was what appeared to have been left sitting under a heat lamp for a long period of time. The tops of the pasta had turned a different shade and became dried out. The bread that came with the 2 salads was over cooked to the point where chewing on them hurt your teeth. The steak was delicious and tender, was without a doubt the nicest dish.
The service was good, the staff were friendly well mannered and welcoming. 

It was a disappointing end to our graduation day as I hoped to impress family travelling up with the dining experience only to be let down with the main dishes. 

It looked like a nice spot for drinks and cocktails with an amazing view and atmosphere ,but couldn't recommend based on the food.",0
Good food and beautiful view! We spent a lovely evening.,2
Setting very good - tempura prawns and seafood linguine good but gnocchi and risotto bland.,1
Everything tasted lovely. Steak were ordered medium rare but came out well done. Other than that was very very good.,2
Food was amazing and the staff was super friendly and helpful! Loved the ambiance and the views are great!,2
"Fabulous meal last night in Sophie's. The view as the sun was going down was just amazing, which really added to the ambience. The rosÃ© was lovely - not all restaurants get it right. The service was great and we were not hurried out of there, so finished up our evening sipping our wine, overlooking the city. My chicken dish was delicious and I don't know what the secret ingredient is in the mash (most likely, loads of butter) but it was divine! I love the place!!",2
Visited for my daughters 10th Birthday - the staff were excellent - food was delivered promptly and overall a very nice experience,2
"Sophie's was fantastic!
My friends and I had a great time.
The ambiance was lovely and you could see the element of quality and they went the extra mile to make sure we had a great time!
The staff surprised me with a cake and even sang happy birthday!

It was a lovely experience overall",2
"Booked table for 2pm 3 customers split bill at pay station, long wait, seated at table, only menu was brunch, no lunch available on bank Holidays. As this was a birthday lunch, very disappointed. Left the restaurant, no Interaction with staff.  Went down to Elephant and Castle, very nice friendly staff food was nice, bit not outstanding. 
Pity, as I'd heard great things about Sophies but was not to be.",1
Prawn starter beautiful and a lovely fillet of beef. Fast and very friendly service. Lovely atmosphere with a live sax which was lovely but a little loud sometimes. Lovely setting and have already booked to go back. Definitely recommend,2
We were met with a lovely waitress who was attentive and knowledgeable. However she was under pressure with a lot of tables and we waited up to 15 minutes for drinks and even water to be brought to table. We choose to have mains as none of the starters took our fancy but were given the hard sell about starters which I found uncomfortable. My duck was bland and the cold salad with it was not a good accompaniment. Wasnât asked how I wanted it cooked I would have said m-r and it was indeed more r-m. Husbands cod was underwhelming. Cocktails were v nice. Facilities and bathrooms lovely. More work needed on service and menus.,1
"Lovely food,presented and seved well,our waiter was very attentive,would reccomend to eat here",2
I coeliac and vegetarian and my choices were  very limited. I opted for the gluten free vegetarian pizza as there wasnt much else. It was the worst gluten free base I have had. It would be better not to have it on the menu as so bad - like cardboard. Topping not great either compared to other vegetarian pizzas I have had. Would not have again. Kids pizza were good. Sides were good. But very over priced for what you get. Not fine dining experience with fine dining prices.,1
"On arrival we were seated by Suzanna, who is  clearly a dedicated professional and enjoys her job. she was warm engaging and knowledgeable and provided attentive service and suggestions in a non intrusive way. Just first class. 

Food was excellent, surroundings were fresh and ambient with ever changing mood of the Galway skyline an additional treat. The music was background chill out style and not intrusive. 

Overall we were very impressed and already looking for reasons to return. Keep up the excellent work, from two happy locals.",2
Loved everything about our experience in Sophieâs and our server Karina was excellent,2
Great food presented by friendly efficient staff. Nice atmosphere,2
"We had a lovely anniversary dinner there, fantastic meal with a great table in the corner for privacy which was sweet but directly under the speakers which played loud dance music through-out our dinner. It was difficult to have a conversation. Suggestion to maybe lower the volume so that it's more ambiance background music?",2
great food and real nice drinks. and service was really good,2
I just think over â¬200 to feed 2 people and have a few drinks is quite expensive. I only had dessert as I was still not full after my main. It's a lovely restaurant with really nice staff though.,2
"Overall very good but the menu not near as good on your cork menu
Also dinner menu didnât open on your app
I added online that it was my partners birthday but nobody mentioned it on the night",2
"We had a wonderful meal here. The food was outstanding. However the service was just ok. 
We had different wait staff and the guy who asked if we wanted to see the desert menu never came back with it. When we asked for the bill he didnât query that he hadnât brought the desert menu. He seemed a bit more interested in the other servers.  We ended up walking away.  We didnât tip and we definitely would have.",2
"Lovely venue, great food and great sevice. I would recommend this.",2
"Starters were good. Mains were very disappointing. (Steak and Duck) Requested duck to be served pink, was over cooked, tough and cold. Steak was very mediocre for the price.

Waiting staff were very nice and engaging, atmosphere was buzzing and very comfortable seating with fabulous views of the city - the food unfortunately letâs it down, would return for drinks but not for a meal â¹ï¸",0
"Cool vibe with great background music, and very attentive staff. Food was very good",2
Overall it was quite disappointing the setting itself is lovely but portions were too small food was nice but nothing wow and desert was summer mess a broken up meringue on a plate with berries scattered and a scoop of ice cream my children could have done it. Waitress was a little pushy and considering we waited a while for food which was OK we were promptly reminded to vacate our table. I'm sorry but I wouldn't be bothered returning too many other places willing to impress customers,0
"Top level and efficient service from the off. Food was outstanding, compliments to the chefs! Will definitely be back again.",2
Was in with my girlfriend for a celebration and the new girl working there was absolutely amazing. Friendly and bubbly. The new menu was amazing along with the cocktails,2
Very slow service particularly for drinks. Didnât bother ordering drinks after dinner as we were too long waiting for order to be taken. Had indicated it was a special birthday (60th) when booking yet no recognition or token/gesture of same,2
"Sophie's offered me some of the best Galway has to offer-- I had a lovely cod entrÃ©e with the scallops ceviche for starters, and everything was delicious and very fresh. Highly recommended!",2
"Second time eating here and i wasn't impressed 
I got Fillet steak and mashed potatoes and my steak was dry and potatoes and pepper sauce were cold",0
"Love the ambience of this rooftop, the duck and the pink drink âthinking of youâ are amazing",2
"The decor and ambiance is amazing ! The food is extremely overpriced and so underwhelming. I ordered the duck, it was tough to eat and not hot and my friend ordered the linguine, which she felt was reheated. Dessert was tasty but aesthetically disappointing.
The cheapest bottle of wine was â¬36. I wouldnt mind paying the money if the food was worth it but it really wasnât and I was really looking forward to it , as I had been before Christmas and enjoyed the goats cheese pizza and cocktails so much. Not worth it ! Would be reluctant to go again not worth the risk with the price",0
"Excellent location and view, friendly staff and yummy food",2
We go here regularly and always love the food and found it to be one of the best places in Galway for high quality tasty food. However this time the menu had changed and there was no risotto or lamb for main course which was very disappointing. The flavour of the food was also very poor. The gnocchi was really bland and doughy and I left most of it behind me. Menu and flavour needs a lot of improvement,1
"Really enjoyable lunch with great service.
Will definitely be back soon",2
Unfortunately the food and service was very poor.  From 2 courses we enjoyed only one starter.  We were waiting very long time not only for a food but at least 15 minutes for dessert menu. The place is lovely but nothing else. I would not recommend this place.,0
Starters came before drinks.Tasteless food. Arrived on the table when we werenât there despite letting staff know we were stepping out. Communication seems off between waiting staff / kitchen and runners,0
We visited Sophieâs for my dadâs 60th birthday meal and it was faultless. The food and service was super and the restaurant has great views of Galway with lovely decor. Would highly recommend!,2
"Waitress was top class.
Starter was delicious.
Main course very good.
Dessert was disappointing.",2
"This was our first visit here. Food and service was great, staff attentive, pleasant and knowledgeable.  Lovely decor.  I would highly recommend Sophieâs  and will definitely be back.",2
We had a lovely work get together here. Food and service were amazing. Venue is beautiful. We had cocktails on the balcony afterwards. Will definitely be back,2
6.50 euros for a pint of Guinness is shocking reason why bar was empty,2
"Hi there 
Paid â¬20 deposit I did not get it back",2
"Glorious weathr, very friendly and eficient staff and the food served was excellent, Would not hesitate to recommend it",2
Food was tasty. Cocktail was delicious ðð¸ another vegetarian option would be nice,2
Great experience. Staff were very helpful and done all they could to make our dinning experience prefect. Food was top quality but found the lunchtime menu a bit restrictive for people with simple tastes. Maybe add a clue sandwich or options similar. I look forward to visiting again,2
"No kids menu (on fathers day)
Could not get a starter as main course, this would incur an additional fee but would not contain a bigger size 
Pizza and Steak was very nice, could not fault the food quality but was very exensive",1
"We went here for breakfast, small menu but definitely something for everyone. The waitstaff leave you alone and only come by if they notice something at your table.  Stunning furniture and atmosphere.  Will be returning.",2
Staff are so helpful and pleasent. Quality of food excellent.,2
"Hi,

We had a nice brunch, service was ok, a bit staggered! Food did not arrive together, we were half way through our breakfast when two of our childrenâs dishes arrived (they were quite busy at the time). We had to remind the waiter to bring the toast, he forgot about it. We ordered 2 teas, it tasted like water ! Ordered a second pot, I said the tea was weak but they still charged for the second pot. I had avocado on toast (on a half slice of sourdough), it was very tasty but tiny ! Luckily my son ordered a pizza that he couldnât finish, otherwise wI would have left still hungry. On the positive, the waiting staff were extremely pleasant and there was a lovely atmosphere. Toilets and premises were spotless and booking via OpenTable was seemless.",1
Lovely food and atmosphere. Very central location.,2
"Beautiful property, terribly let down by its kitchen, totally inaccurate menu offering from advertised on website, sparce is  putting it mildly, should have left when this menu was presented.
Awful food, I really have had better at a roadside stop 
Clearly no chef put this out, the fact that no member of the floor staff asked how we were doing says it all, I had to bring it to the attention on paying, in fairness the chap took my comments, and gave a discount,  we headed to the huntsman Inn for our usual lovely breakfast.",0
"Top class in every way and the food was spot on.

Great before, during and after meal",2
"Beautiful restaurant and great food, was well worth the visit and would go there again!",2
"Three of us had an early dinner before catching a train back to Dublin. The place was pretty empty so it was quiet. The service was excellent. Two of us had the lamb shoulder which was fall-apart tender and very tasty. The other had the sirloin which was also nicely flavored and tender. It was a Monday night, and early, which may explain the lack of clientele. Two other parties came in before we left. I hope more people will give it a try.",2
Friendly staff. Good food. Vibrant. Good service. Def be back again,2
Went for a birthday dinner for my Mother. Staff were very attentive and friendly. Great choice on their menus and good servings of food! Beautiful decor and views of Galway. No complaints at all.,2
"Really enjoyed our girls night at Sophieâs last night. We ordered a second bottle of wine however which was never brought to us, and our sides arrived when we were well into eating our meal, other than that, it was a lovely evening and food was exceptional.",2
"Staff are brilliant, very quick to take orders and remove finished items. Spoke to us about our plans for the rest of the evening etc. Food was nice, not the greatest food I've ever eaten but definitely worth it. Nice vibes in the restaurant, the desert plate with happy anniversary was a very nice touch",2
"Not too much choice for breakfast and expensive for what it was. Very quiet, although nicely decorated it was lacking in atmosphere. It was ok but would not go back.",1
Sophieâs is an excellent spot to grab a quick drink or dine in. We went as part of our honeymoon and had a wonderful time!,2
"Overall we had a pleasurable evening in the Dean in Galway. It was very quiet there so not busy enough for the service we got.
The food was lovely but the service wasn't great...",2
Main course was literally a starter size - complete rip off!! Wonât be back,0
"Great experience all round, the food was amazing, staff were friendly and attentive.",2
"We recently had a great brunch there with a stunning view of Galway, and the staff was incredibly friendly. The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. You won't be disappointed.",2
"Food was very tasty - tempura prawns, pizza and calzone. Good selection of lager and cocktails.  Service was prompt and polite.  Unfortunately very little space between tables.",2
"Excellent service, lovely waiter, very knowledgable about wine, superb food",2
Been here a few times and always return. Lovely staff and food was amazing. It was quick and fresh. Stunning scenes over Galway whether youâre inside or out. Always recommend!,2
Only two unnecessarily extremely bland and unimaginative vegan options.,0
All is well grate panorama all around Galway City it's a nice place for parties with friends or rendezvous...,2
"Service was friendly, food was great and the lovely birthday surprise for my mum was very well received. The views from the balcony are stunning, so make sure to pop out for a few mins before or after your dinner.",2
"Great food, and the views are spectacular!  The cocktail list is fantastic too!",2
"I have dined at the Dublin location and had a very pleasant experience and so was looking forward to trying this Sophie's in Galway. Unfortunately, this experience was just fair at best. There seemed to be only two wait staff handling the entire restaurant the evening we were there, and so service was not quite attentive. For example, we had waited quite a while to get our first round of cocktails order in. Hopefully it was just an ""off"" night because otherwise the rooftop ambience is nice.",2
Lovely views over the city. Friendly service. Very good food but drinks service was not great. Forgetting to bring things. Very late with the wine. Ambience lovely.,2
Asked for a few slices of tomato with my steak and rocket leaves and waitress returned apologetically telling me the chefs wouldnât give her tomatoes!,1
"Top Pizza in Top Venue. Always a nice experience, very nice starters!",2
Sophieâs was fab!  The food and drinks were lovely and the service was fantastic. They were very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. My group and I will definitely be returning.,2
Beautiful place in Galway perfect for drinks or a nice date place,2
"Fabulous food served promptly by excellent hosts. 
We enjoyed a beautiful cocktail on arrival.
The Focaccia starter was lovely as was my 10oz sirloin steak, cooked to perfection.
We enjoyed the beautiful views from the rooftop terrace after dinner.
Highly recommended ð",2
Friendly staff. Good food. Great view. I would have prefereed more vegetarian options,2
"It was great to celebrate my birthday in such a gorgeous place. Staff, food, drinks all great. The sunshine was perfect for the pleasant evening time.",2
"Beautiful venue, excellent service.  Food is very nice, if a little expensive.",2
"Had a wonderful meal, stunning sunset views. Great service and food. Would highly recommend the cod main course - delicious",2
Beautiful place the staff were lovely service was slow but the staff apologized for the delay and when the food did come if was lovely.,2
Very nice experience. Staff were pleasant and welcoming.,2
"Really enjoyable birthday celebrations. Staff were friendly, engaging and the service excellent. There was a nice selection of dishes and cocktails to be had and the food was just delicious. The setting is second to none and a trip to Sophies has to be high on your list of things to do. Great experience. Thanks All!",2
Food was amazing and the cocktails were delicious. Staff were very friendly,2
"Lovely dining experience, great atmosphere & food with spectacular views over: Galway city, Galway Bay, Hills of Clare & River Corrib. We will be back.",2
"Waited 20 mins for drinks. Uninspiring menu choices. Service was friendly but slow. Half bottle carafe of wine would have been a good option. Great view, ideal for groups",0
Fantastic evening. Really good food. Service was second to none. Lovely restaurant would definitely recommend.,2
"The food was AMAZING and the staff were so friendly, polite and professional.  Great dinning experience from start to finish!!!",2
Fabulous food  great service,2
Really enjoyable lunch. Top marks to Rita on her fab service.,2
"The restaurant was very quiet, we moved table because there was staff having meetings near us and it didnt feel like we were out for lunch as we could hear them and see them standing around that table. I had mentioned on the booking it was our anniversary, but nothing said. The greeting and showing to the table was only ok, not a very warm welcome, we have eaten in elephant and castle on the ground floor multiple times and much more welcoming there. We waited nearly 45 mins for the food in a restaurant with about 4 tables occupied! All in all it was an average experience",1
"Beautiful setting and views, excellent pizza. Good service. Drinks service from the bar downstairs could have been quicker - the bar seemed a little understaffed.",2
We recommand ! Very good dinner at Sophieâs. Thank you !,2
The cocktails were good as well as the food and the overall atmosphere but the service was a bit slow and we had to ask multiple times before we got our drinks.,2
"Very disappointed with staff,
Brought 4 wrong orders to our table and questioned us when we said one particular order was not ours.. seemed quiet rude and disrespectful. 
Asked us 3 times to vacate the table to prepare for dinner. It would have been helpful to know there was a time limit on the reservation. It wasnât indicated when the table was reserved. Waited 20 mins for the staff to return to order a coffee. Other venues are much more professional who offer the rooftop restaurant.",0
"Amazing experience, great views and excellent food. If you are home sick from the US, this is an excellent option.",2
"Great atmosphere, food was beautiful and atmosphere was class, real trendy.",2
"We really enjoyed our evening at Sophieâs. Great atmosphere, staff friendly and welcoming.",2
Food was lovely staff were lovely and helpful view and decor lovely,2
Me and my girlfriend went to Sophieâs on a couples trip to Galway and had a really lovely experience. The service was fab and they had some items on the menu that were affordable for us as we are college students. Would definitely recommend if you would like to have a fancy dinner and then bring your drinks outside onto the rooftop balcony afterwards.overall will definitely eat there again :),2
"Staff were extremely helpful and friendly, made us feel very welcome.  Food was delicious and you could tell only the best ingredients were used.  Looking forward to my next visit there.",2
"The venue is brilliant for an elevated occasion , or a beautiful lunch on a sunny day. The staff was great and accommodating, food is very tasty. The drink list is custom, but if you're looking for an out of menu coctail, the bartenders will make it as well.  Very nice and atmospheric, can reccomend and definitely will come back",2
"Fabulous decor, great food & wine, highly recommended. Peigs bar downstairs is lovely for a drink after dinner.",2
"Just loved this place, great decor, food & service and ambiance. Will deffo be back",2
Respectful staff. They have good communication skills,2
"Great atmosphere, friendly fast service, good food.",2
"I came here with a group of friends traveling to Galway and we loved our experience dining here. The cocktails were delicious, and the food was even better while still not breaking the bank. Not to mention the views from the restaurant were amazing. All around the whole restaurant was inviting and friendly due to the impeccable service. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone I know coming to Galway.",2
"Great food, friendly efficient service. Lovely cocktails. Decent pricing",2
"Absolutely fantastic venue and fantastic food . 

Loved it .

Music in the backround was a little loud but that was just  for me . 

Overall outstanding and ill be going back again without hesitation . 

10/10

Well done",2
"Good service. Food was fairly overpriced and underdelivered. Prawn tempura starter was just prawns in a thick batter, not great. Mains of cod and lamb seemed like they'd been sitting a while before we got them, dry discoloured veg and congealed souce on the lamb, really salty cod. Both sauces (on the fish and the lamb) we're very good though. Caraffe of house wine was poor, sour and 30 euro.. Disappointing food overall and not worth the price point.",1
Lovely food and great service. Really enjoyed the meal!,2
"Disappointing! Had put in a request for a cake to celebrate wife's birthday when booking the table. There were a couple of birthdays on other tables and I was waiting for it to arrive any time, unfortunately the bill came first and it was too late then to enquire about it. Please don't provide an option for special requests if they cannot be honoured. But the food and ambience weren't bad, shame it came to a disappointing end.",2
Great place for a anniversary dinner. We were both delighted with the service and food. Will definitely come again.,2
"No desserts offered, coffees unavailable. The service was very good until a point. We love the place, the food is good. Wine list could be improved, price wise and selection wise. We will come back!",2
"Lovely place to eat. Everything was very good, comfortable and cosy. Food was really tasty and service very good. No complaints.",2
"The best is the view over the city and surrounding areas from the terrace.
The food was good.
I can recommend to visit this place.",2
Cocktails werent good. We had 2 ams none wdre good. Blond waitress not friendly.,1
Great atmosphere and food. Bit noisy in terms of background music.,2
"Food was amazing I can't wait to go back there.  Staff were so good and service was great. 

Coffee was the only thing that i got that let me down. Horrible coffee I am sorry to say. I would get nicer in McDonald's",2
"The ambience was lovely. Big city feel to it. Decor with wood finish and cedar wood scent very pleasing. Service was excellent. Food was nice but lacked real ""wow"" factor to match the restaurant surroundings.",0
Not a lot of options for coeliacs. Kitchen wouldn't make a chicken salad for a starter so I had to make do with a few dressed salad leaves. No effort was made to provide any starter that I could eat. Really not good enough for an establishment of this calibre.,2
Lovely staff and great atmosphere. The rooftop is amazing with 360 views of Galway. Very relaxed atmosphere and great selection of food and cocktails. I would definitely recommend for a nice occasion.,2
Newest rooftop that gets you away from the college scene! Very swanky and enjoyable.,2
"This was my 3rd visit to Sophieâs and left uninspired by the menu, as there was no exciting/ new additions- I simply opted for a pizza. This establishment is great for a quick bite to eat in a lovely and casual but elegant setting.",2
"Lovely restaurant, great view, food was excellent, and staff were friendly. Will definitely book again.",2
"Had a fabulous evening out for my husbands birthday, attentive staff, delicious food highly recommend.",2
"Overall, the food was delicious and the service was excellent. We really appreciated the side orders being modified to be vegan.
We were disappointed however that the pizzas were not available and that the vegan option on the online menu was not available. We would have appreciated an email informing us as a large part of why we booked Sophieâs was based on the menu.",2
Fab food views and cocktails. Would definitely recommend.,2
Lovely dinner for our anniversary.  Good service and great food,2
"Dine at Sophie's rooftop restaurant. Great food, service and enjoy it all with a view",2
Lovely meal for my birthday. Fab service and lovely food,2
"Lovely evening in Sophies. Our first time visiting. Food was outstanding! The prawns to start were delicious. I had lamb for mains and it was probably the nicest lamb I have ever had. The meat fell apart as soon as you cut it.

Canât wait to go back.",2
"The waiters were very rude - my friend was 10 mins late and they came over to my table three times asking when she would arrive. When she did arrive, she was greeted with ""Oh you're finally here"".  They rushed us to order - one waiter came over, we were not ready. The other came down less than a minute later. They told us breakfast was finishing at 10 and lunch was starting at 12. There was no brunch menu offered in between. 
Asked for salmon as a side and was not available, even though it is offered on the Galway Breakfast Menu for Sophies on the Dean website.
Overall, not impressed with service.",0
Nice ambience and service. The food was very tasty,2
"Good quality, well prepared food. Feels like you don't get a whole dinner unless you order a side to pair with the main.",2
Overall just brilliant great food and service highly recommended,2
Very nice experience! Would go there again. Had a grate date night and food was lovely. We had the risotto and chicken supreme. Very nice service too and lively view!,2
"I took my husband for a branch. It was very nice! I love the decor of the restaurant. The food was delicious, I was jealous about my husband dish. He had a tempura white fish with fries. The fish was fresh with crispy tempura and mash peas and tatar sauce. I had the pizza with goat cheese it was also good. After we had our coffee on the terrace. Great place to relax and enjoy the view.
I can easily recommend the Sophie's restaurant. We will definitely come back, this time for a dinner timeð.",2
"We have eaten quite a few times at Sophieâs Dublin and Bonnies Glasson however this was a complete let down! 
From the oh we donât do seafood chowder anymore too oh sorry we are out of Hendricks gin it really kicked us off to a bad start. Considering Hendricks is the main ingredient in the signature Sophieâs cocktail.
Wouldnât return, Dublin and Glasson could give them a lesson in service.",0
"Food was delicious, found drinks very overpriced. Would recommend it as a venue to visit for food and atmosphere. It was a bit disappointing to be asked to leave the table at a certain time after we had our main course so maybe check this out when you book (even if late sitting).",2
Our favourite spot in Galway to date! Great cocktails and amazing food! Views 10/10 canât wait to go back!,2
Fab brunch in a great setting with excellent service,2
Really enjoyable meal with fantastic service and delicious food,2
Great food. Fantastic atmosphere.,2
Overall it was a present dinner but the people beside us were very drunk and while they were there I found it hard to hear my partner but service were very kind and welcoming and the restaurant had a great atmosphere and will definitely visit again,2
"Very nice, no need to say much more, well worth it",1
"Pleasant waitress, long wait, not value for money",0
"Lots of positive things about the place but I came and twice food was cold did not make a fuss as I was business dinnerâ¦ also menu very short + items missing on it â¦ So became very restrictiveâ¦ 
But flavour of the food were delicious..
Also wine came when we had finished our starterâ¦ I am not off the place I still like it but must improve on details.",1
"Really nice atmosphere/decor ideal for girly lunches, food is fine not something that would make you rush back, staff very friendly but a few are flighty in forgetting to make a drinks order or drop something down. Cocktails are okay again not anything better than what u might pay a little less for in another establishment. Overall id prb go back if i wanted to be somewhere that looked fancy but if i was looking for something extra special food wise prob not.",1
"It was grand, but nothing special. Door was open and when we asked for it to be closed (it was freezing) we were made to feel fussy.",1
"The setting is amazing, on the night we were there the service and staff were amazing. The food was fine, nothing overly exciting and expensive for what it was. Cocktails were fab.",2
Sophies is a fabulous venue and the cocktails are delicious. I really enjoyed the food on this visit but feel there is definitely room for improvement with the staff,2
Saturday brunch was a bit of a disappointment as it took us 40 minutes to get a drink and then service was generally poor as it did not look like enough staff.,2
"Food excellent, service prompt and friendly and overall setting and decor very cool. Found it quite pricey compared to other restaurants of a similar calibre in Galway. Cocktail in particular was very tasty but very small and seems this is trying to be hidden a bit by serving it in a tiny glass. Overall a lovely experience, wouldn't dine there regularly but great place for a special occasion.",2
Chicken supreme was so delicious and the Cod was so good as well,2
"Great atmosphere, excellent food and value for money.",2
"Lovely brunch at Sophie's.  Staff really friendly and helpful, food good, location unreal, would recommend.",2
"An amazing night for my birthday was well looked after , food was amazing and came out in no time couldn't fault the place will definitely be returning.",2
"The quality of the tea was very poor, would be lovely to have Barryâs Tea .",2
"Had a great time with family at Sophie's, with our new little baby Sophie. Food was decent and the waiter was great, however, we were really looking forward to certain items on the lunch menu, but when we arrived, we were advised that only brunch was served on the weekend and not lunch. This should have been stipulated on Open Table and/or on the website and/or on the menus themselves, which I'd downloaded from the website. On Sophie's website it states: We serve breakfast, lunch and dinner daily with a delectable brunch menu on the weekends.

It does not state that they do not serve lunch on the weekend. We would have chosen to go another restaurant because we were specifically looking for other items, but by the time we got there, with a 6 year old and 1 month old baby in tow, it was too much of mission to then pack up and go somewhere else.",2
Great place in Galway! New atmosphere! good food fully recommended!,2
"All was excellent for the background music which although wasnt loud, was overwhelming due to its style.",2
"Unreal experience!!fab atmosphere. Best service, lovely friendly staff",2
"We enjoyed a lovely lunch in Sophies. The service was fabulous. Views around Galway, really nice atmosphere. The decor is beautiful. Would recommend visiting!",2
"The food was presenting beautifully. Every course was delicious and the food came out quickly and at a perfect temperature.
Really enjoyed the cocktails and the views over Galway  are beautiful",2
"This is my second visit to Sophieâs Restaurant .
Both nights  really enjoyed.
Food excellentâ Staff excellent and service excellent.
First Night âgirls night out  â all loved the Food and 
Cocktails yum.
New Years Day Couples night out food excellent, service excellent .
Definitely a Treat to look forward to.
If you Donât know what to have ask Staff to recommend and you wonât be disappointed.",2
"No Gluten free bread available is poor form, shops were open could have got some in if you ran out",1
"Nice spot in Galway, when we were there the staff were so pleasant & attentive.",2
"Yeah, an enjoyable experience on a busy night! Food is good, the service was very attentive and it's an interesting venue.",2

"We were disappointed that the pizza oven was not working - this is the 2nd time this has happened to us but food & staff were very good.
Thank you.",2
"Lovely night from start to finish, good service and festive atmosphere",2
"Great food and atmosphere. We had a lovely waiter who was very busy so this led to a slower service, but this did not affect our evening. Looking forward to going again.",2
"Excellent meal & ambience. Very atmospheric. Attentive staff. Just perfect from start to finish. Thank you, looking forward to returning.",2
"Lovely restaurant/hotel and staff, the only thing is the tables were far too close to eachother. We struggled to have a conversation as I kept hearing the people next to us both sides. Also getting in and out beside them was awkward, it felt like we were on a triple date. Other than the seating layout the rest was lovely",2
"Great service, food delicious, a bit pricey but ok for a special occasion",2
"Service fantastic!
Food was really good, as were the cocktails.",2
"Great food, service & ambience. Hotel is quality too. Staff are superb & so friendly. Would definitely recommend.",2

Very enjoyable St.Stephenâs Day meal. Staff were great and table was perfect.,2
Had a fabulous Christmas eve brunch. Super staff who  made us feel most welcome.  Special thanks to Andrew.,2
We had Christmas eve brunch here and everything was outstanding. Food and drinks were amazing. The atmosphere was amazing and staff were very attentive.,2
Great food and fantastic service. Would recommend to others.,2
Really good food and lovely ambience. Lovely view and cool bar,2
I found the food nice but it took so long to come out.,1
"Expensive steaks, both not cooked to order. One way over and the other way under, a member of staff who was not our waitress had me slide my steak onto a side plate to bring it back to the kitchen. 25% discount and a complimentary drink, but we where seated near the reception and watched 3/4 members of the team debate how to handle the situation. It was uncomfortable and and disappointing overall.",0
Good drinks menu and lovely food,2
"White wine on tap not cold at all, music and noise level too loud, not a relaxed atmosphere, all tables in walkway in line along windows and some just opposite, everyone has to pass in between.",0
"Restaurant looks fantastic, was very dissapointed in the food.

Steak main for â¬34 was main dissapointment.",0
We were celebrating the graduation of one of our staff members,2
"I've eaten Sophie's twice in a week, once on a work dinner with a large group, once a more intimate meal with my partner. On both occasions the service was superb and the food was great.  The prawn starter was close to perfect and the mains were well executed, balanced and tasty. Sides are very  generous portions. The cocktails were very good, both taste and presentation.

Highly recommend Pegs Select Bar downstairs for a nightcap to end  the evening.",2
"Service was brilliant, we had a lovely female waiter who was very friendly and very efficient. Enjoyed the cocktails and food. Festive atmosphere - would definitely go back.",2
"Loved the decor and ambience, seated at a lovely table, food was delicious- had the tempura prawns and slow cooked lamb and both were lovely. Good wine selection too. 
We found out waitress to be unfriendly, very abrupt and it definitely tainted our experience.",2
"Great experience here as always.
Class food and Service!",2
The food was very bland no taste to it I could have gone to supermacks for a better burger and it wouldn't have cost that much for it.,0
"Beautiful location, lovely decor, great food and lovely staff and great atmosphere.
One small issue is no parking for customers",2
"Good food. Lovely, helpful and efficient staff. Nice atmosphere.",2
"Fabulous venue, very poor menu, pumpkin risotto in December, Two steaks a chicken dish and cod â¦. Thatâs it, we opted for pizza. Pizza swiping pesto and cheese.",1
Beautiful food. Great location and atmosphere.  Good service but lacking a personal touch.,2
"Staff - good and professional. But I am disappointed with my experience, it was my daughters birthday and I booked to have brunch only to be told when I arrived brunch only happens at wkds! Ok with that but put out we ordered from the lunch menu, 50 mins later I was told the pizza oven was not working and we were asked to order something else from the menu we did that and another half hour we had to wait for our food. After we got our food we both iced other customers ordered pizza and got same delivered to their tables!! My daughter was extremely disappointed! The service was extremely slow I had to ask for a menu for deserts and we had to wait for same. Then I got the bill and although there was a discount due to the pizza oven being out of order I was gobsmacked. All in all as we were very excited for this experience and itâs not everyday your daughter turns 10 and you want to really spoil her but I am truly disappointed with my experience at Sophieâs.",1
Had cocktailâs here before and they were amazing- wanted to go back for dinner with friends as it has a cool urban vibe not just for couples. Wasnât expecting much from service or food due to previous reviews but we were really pleasantly surprised. The cocktails and wine again great. The staff were so lovely and so attentive and the food was really good- I will definitely go back soon,2
"It is a great location with amazing food, excellent service and a great vibe! Highly recommended",2
It was great experienced and food lovely over all itâs nice..bit pricey but it was lovelyâs experience to dine in to sophie and the staff were so attentive .. definitely we will come back,2
We were a party of six. We had a beautiful private table at the end of the restaurant. The menu was gorgeous. The quality of the food was superb. Everything was beautifully presented. Service was excellent. It is expensive but it is worth it as a special treat. We will be back next year!,2
"They took our order for starters and mains and came back 5 minutes later to tell us that some of the dishes were no longer available. We then had to make a new order.
The service was quite slow. (We waited almost an hour for main courses and about 25 minutes for desserts)
28 Euro for a small main course is a little too much.
The waitress was not super friendly. We had to keep asking for things like a refill of our water, ketchup and mayo for the chips etc. It would have been nicer if the waitress brought these things without having to be asked.",2
From the moment we walked through the door we were greeted by friendly and attentive staff. Was great night sitting above Galway Town in a stylish friendly venue.,2
Absolutely stunning decor and beautiful atmosphere do warm and inviting absolutely loved everything â¤ï¸,2
"Atmosphere and setting was great. Food was only ok and given how much they charge, it should have been really good.  Obviously, I don't feel there's value for money here. Service was very slow. All the staff were lovely and there were plenty of them so I don't know why it took so long to bring drinks or take orders. For instance, we ordered a bottle of wine when food was delivered but didn't receive it until we were nearly finished.",0
"Pizza was lovely, had a lovely view and service was fantastic",2
"Amazing! Food, staff and of course the cocktails excellent . Highly recommend and will return.",2
"The tables are too close together, it feels like you are having dinner with strangers.

Everything else was excellent other than the table layout",2
"Love the roof top views, fast service, great atmosphere, excellent food ð",2
Waited an hour for our food with a 2.5 year old. Wish they told us the kitchen was that behind when we arrived. Many other diners left unhappy as well.,0
Made a special request for my partners birthday and it was never fulfilled and when I picked up my burger the slice of tomato was so big water came dripping out and then Iâm was soggy,0
The venue is fab and atmosphere was electric but the food was really poor. I had smoked salmon with crab meat to start. The presentation was poor and it was not worth the money charged. The steak I asked for medium well. It came out like a pork job so over cooked swallowing it was really difficult. My husbands was the same. The couple next to us sent back their steaks due to the poor quality of it. I should of known then to change my order. The cost of it was ridiculous at â¬35. When I told the waitress and showed her how bad it was her eyes could not of gotten any wider with shock at the steak presented to me. Really disappointed with the overall experience. We didnât get dessert in the end because of the poor experience with the food. The restaurant would want to pull up their socks especially with those prices.,0
"Great food in a fantastic setting , cocktails lovely!!",2
Excellent service,2
"My daughter and I went to Sophie's for our second meal there together. I felt that the food and service had vastly improved since our last visit in June 2022. I had a delicious risotto and my daughter said her cheeseburger was really good. We had two really lovely mocktails also and a tiramisu for dessert which was also very good and all food was nicely presented.
The decor is gorgeous and ambience was relaxting. The staff were attentive, effiicient and really pleasant to deal with. I look forward to going back again.",2
Great views and location! Food was really nice and not crowded early am,2
"Our first drink arrived after we had finished our starter. As we were out celebrating this was disappointing. When the drinks did arrive, the Bloody Mary was not good.

Second time round,  I ordered a vodka and tomato juice instead of a Bloody Mary. The tomato juice arrived in a black jugâ¦.very off putting and tasted horrible.

The prawn starter was poor- tempura prawns on far to much warm Marie rose like sauce.

Steak was very good.

Lamb was only ok.",0
Sophieâs is a great venue. Wonderful atmosphere and views combined with excellent food and super service.,2
"We had breakfast at 9am, place was quite and we sat near the window to the rear.. Service was quick.. Enjoyed the meal",2
Staff was not at friendly. The waitress behaviour very bad. My friend told me she was making face when we was ordering food. I will never go back there..,1
"1st time eating in Sophies, Galway and really enjoyed the experience. Staff were excellent ,very friendly and attentive. Really enjoyed brunch. Would highly recommend.",2
"Food was very average. Service was poor , staff very busy and hard to get attention. Cocktails priority over food orders. Brunch menu was poor , mix of eggs , pizza or fish and chips seems strange combination. Tables are very close together making it hard to leave your seat without bumping another table.",0
"Had a lovely lunch here, fabulous views, lovely friendly and quick staff, could not recommend this place more!",2
"Really enjoyed the food the quality was very good,eye catching room decor,great vibe cant wait to go back",2
"Fab staff, very well taken care of. The girl that gave me the bill was so lovely and I felt so taken care of the second I walked into the place",2
"Beautiful place! Perfect location, lovely atmosphere,  very good food.  It was family lunch for a special occasion. We ordered risotto, pizzas and tiramisu, brownie and caramel delice for dessert. Everything was really good and tasty. The wine list is impressive. We chose Puglian wine and it was amazing. We had a wonderful time in there. Thank you!",2
Very nice food with a great view of the Galway city skyline,2
Very pleasant bar food style lunch. Lovely views from dining room.,2
"Very good venue, interesting view and great ambiance, pizza oven next to the bar, excellent coffee, very good food.",2
Amazing atmosphere and meal. Absolutely lovely,2
Fantastic all round.,2
Booked for Sophie roof top restaurant. Upon arrival for elderly mother's birthday lunch who has poor mobility we're ushered downstairs to tge elephant and castle. Staff member said something about gas not working but tables were full. Asked if we'd received a call which we hadn't. Told I'll see you downstairs in a few minutes..never happened. Expected an apology or be offered a coffee...nothing. resturant downstairs didn't even know we were coming...made for a poor first impression â¹ï¸,1
"I don't usually write reviews but I wanted to say a huge thank you to the staff of Sophie's. We had brunch there on Sunday and enjoyed every minute. We were recommended a great wine and the food was so tasty, with larger portions than expected. Thanks again for a brilliant number of hours spent chilling, chatting, eating, drinking and enjoying the atmosphere and rooftop views",2
"We had an amazing experience on Saturday 19th in Sophie's. Two of our party had food intolerances and our waiter went above and beyond to ensure  their meals were perfect and free from dairy and gluten. 
Our waiter was amazing and a credit to the business and himself. 

I look forward to my next experience in Sophie's",2
"Lovely food as always and amazing drinks! Service was really good, we had this Portuguese waiter with lots of banter. The decor is one of my favourite ones in Galway and the atmosphere never disappoints. This time it was a few of us ladies getting together for a pre-Christmas evening and we thoroughly enjoyed it.",2
"Lovely place, but no kids menu. To me, this suggests kids are not welcome?? So though itâs a lovely place, eating out with kids here is very expensive.",2
"Ambiance is 5 star!  Food was lovely, apart from a pizza that was slightly underdone.",2
Fab food and lovely restaurant! Ser ice was excellent. Will definitely be back.,2
Very disappointed. Did not have the wine we wanted. Did not have pizza. Also paid for a brownie I thought was complimentary for a birthday ð,0
Fantastic service and food. Will be returning in the future.,2
"Very enjoyable.  Steak was expensive, tasty but not amazing.
Tables are close together, quiet bright interior.",2
"I would describe our overall dining experience at The Dean underwhelming and disappointing. 

My partner and I ordered two Eggs Benedict. The presentation lacked any imagination and were so overcooked, I would describe them as hard boiled eggs as opposed to Eggs Benedict. My fiancÃ© is a celiac and so ordered gluten-free bread with hers. The bread was rock hard and dry to the point, she could barely cut it with her knife. 

No one came back to check on our order once our food arrived, which could have solved what happened next. There was a mix up with our drinks order. My fiancÃ©âs drink and a bottle of water for the table was missing from our order. The cocktail arrived so late, the meal was almost over and our water did not arrive at all, even after  asking twice for it. 

My fiancÃ© gained the attention of a member of staff to enquire about the drinks order but was rudely spoken to, and told âyea, one minuteâ. 

The waitress did not return and so I had to get up eventually and physically go to the bar to enquire about our drinks. There was confusion amongst staff at the bar, and by the time my fiancÃ©eâs drink did arrive she had all by near finished her food. 

It was evident from observation that the tables beside us had problems with their orders also. 

The location and decor is the only positive aspect to report on following our dining experience at The Dean. The food, staff and service unfortunately did not live up to expectations. Based from our experience we will not be returning, and would not recommend overall.",0
Most amazing experience. Food was lovely. The service was outstanding,2
"Lovely dinner, service excellent and the food was very good.",2
"We always enjoy Sophie's - best view in town, very good food and drink, great service",2
Good food and excellent service in a really fantastic setting.,2
Very nice place to go. Good atmosphere and friendly staff.,2
A lovely experience would highly recommend a visit to Sophie's.,2
A truly great night at Sophieâs.. food was all amazing . We were a family of 4 and every dish was outstanding.. quirky cocktails were delish..,2
"Food was good, hit the spot for what we wanted. I cannot recall the servers name but he wa Excellent interacted with us at the table, gave recommendations when we weren't sure.",2
"Amazing food, great service and an incredible view ð",2
"Food portions were quite small for brunch.
Avocado wasnât fresh avocado , seemed like bottled avocado.

Staff were efficient but hard to distinguish staff from customers due to lack of uniform. 

On the plus - Decor was fabulous",0
"We attended Sophieâs restaurant for a friends bday. Cocktails were fabulous, the food was amazing and staff outstanding. An outstanding dining experience. Thank you Sophies restaurant.",2
"Great Food & Service.
Will definitely be back!",2
"We thought the menu was quite limited. We had our children with us for my daughters birthday and other than pizza there was nothing suitable on the menu for them. 
The service was excellent but the wait for the food was quite long.",1
"The ambient was not as expected. The is no carpark at The Dean in Galway, which is very,very bad. 
Waiters were in jeans and need some  training.  
Food was okay, but not more than just okay. The best was cheese board as dessert. 
In total, we won't go again - no value for money. Very disappointed.",1
"Went for brunch - unfortunately the eggs Benedict wasnât good, the bread was completely stale and inedible so only ate the eggs and bacon from the top. I ideally would have asked for something else as it wasnât much food without it but nobody came over after the food was dropped over to check in, and we were unable to get anyones attention. An expensive bill!",0
Lovely restaurant and nice food. I highly recommend.,2
"Had an amazing experience at Sophies last night. Having eaten there three times in the last 6 months I've noticed a dramatic improvement in the service- the staff were helpful, attentive and very communicative. 
We had a combination of pizza and fish dishes and all were 5 stars! Would definitely recommend.",2
Really nice restaurant with good food and a great view of Galway city,2
Food was excellent worth the price would recommend,2
Food was good . Service slow . Waiting for drinks & food for quiet awhile .,2
"Loved the ambience for sure. Beautifully designed and i loved how the team was coming to ask âif everything is okay or require any assistanceâ. 
Loved the sides and pizzaâ¥ï¸
Drinks were also upto the markð¥
Thankyou for the great service.",1
Service was super and cocktails very good,1
"The only complaint I could have is that it was difficult to get a weekend reservation, but I think that is a good sign! Everything was top drawer. Even down to the restrooms being spotless which is odd for Galway. 

My wife got the salmon starter and risotto for her main course along with a cocktail which she said tasted amazing, but it had her more shook than a hand at mass :) Which is good that they can make a cocktail that tastes great while getting you on a good buzz.

I got the smoked bacon corquette for starter and the rib eye. It was very good.

It is a bit expensive, but the quality is up there with the high reputation restaurants in town and is cheaper than most of those restaurants.

The ambience was nice and I loved the view. We will be back for sure.",2
Food was average at best. Overcooked poached eggs and not very warm. Pizza oven not heated so not an option. No decaf coffee. Menu is expensive so feels like you're pay for the surroundings and not the quaity the food. Disappointing as it's a lovely place to go.,0
"Very good service, food wasnât great. Steak was way too tough found it hard to cut. Desserts were poor. Nice atmosphere and staff were so helpful and friendly.",1
"Food, service and drinks all great can't fault it. A little bit on the pricey side but experience was amazing.",2
"Everything was lovely, made us feel special on our anniversary. Staff were lovely and friendly. Cocktails were delish!",2
Had a fabulous brunch with my sister. Staff were lovely and food was great. Can't wait to go back!,2
Really enjoyed our evening at Sophie's at the Dean.,2
Lovely rooftop restaurant. Food was great as was service. The only downside was the acoustics - very hard to have a conversation- too many hard surfaces coupled with all the glass didnt help.,2
"Great location, beautiful food and lovely staff ð",2
Amazing atmosphere and the most lovely helpful staff,2
"I was really looking forward to going to Sophies but sadly was disappointed. I ordered the Panko Fried Chicken (â¬16.95) and the chicken was hard, burnt, dry, and flavourless. All the ingredients listed on the menu were thrown on top of each other in a bun that you couldn't fit in your mouth if you dislocated your jaw, and couldn't be  smashed any smaller due to the hard chicken. I told the waitress and she said she'd tell the chef but nothing came of it. I also ordered a prosecco and the glass was chipped. This was replaced ""on the house"" but overall I was left feeling that Sophies was overpriced, overrated, and underwhelming. There is a wealth of brilliant restaurants in Galway that do incredible brunches - Nimmos, Kitchen, Corrib House, Dela, to name a few - so Sophies has stiff competition and would want to earn their hefty prices. The setting was nice and the view was good, but the food (which is what we are there for at the end of the day) let the place down.",0
They seemed short staffed and weâre running around to cover all the tables. Service was not very attentive. I had to get our own menus. The food was delicious. I used my credit card at the till to pay but was charged on my room for someone elseâs meal.  There seemed to be confusion about what the table numbers were with the staff.,2
"Had a beautiful night at the Dean last night celebrating our Wedding Anniversary, the lady serving us was so nice and friendly, and engaging with us throughout our time there, as were all the staff.  Would definitely recommend it, the Chef even sent a special lovely dessert to us at the end of our meal for our Anniversary.",2
Lovely food but the chips were cold and had been cooked a while before serving. They didnât seem fresh. But it wouldnât stop us returning and recommending!,2
Andrew is an excellent manager who helped to look after us really well. Will be back!,2
Excellent food and service. A little noisy due to the large volume of customers. Would also have preferred the music to be slightly slower and the lighting less.,2
"We ordered steak and lamb, a  little expensive but very tasty. The interior and view of Galway is amazing.",2
Fantastic food and loved the cocktails! Second time being there and already planning to come back!,2
Food is expensive for what it is. It would be nice to be able to go for a few drinks without having to have food,1
The restaurant itself is very beautiful and hip. It has a very good atmosphere and the food is delicious. Our server was very helpful when it came to recommending gluten free options. Would definitely come back and recommend to people.,2
Wonderful staff and exceptional service. Portions very generous and fantastic cocktail menu,2
Delicious food. Really decent portion sizes. Lovely restaurant with gorgeous views.,2
Great experience canât wait go go back! Dined indoor & had drinks outdoor,2
"Very good food,  staff very friendly and helpful.",2
"Not much option for vegan, pizza was doughy & undercooked. Fruit fly buzzing around us all evening. Service no fault. Nice venue, needs tweaks",1
"The Good 
- Fab setting with panoramic views over the city. 
- The staff were all very pleasant
- The food was good, we all had different dishes and all were good..the presentation was nice
- The ambiance was good 

The Bad
- The service was VERY slow
- The prices are high compared to similar food served locally
- Not much choice for non-meat eaters and/or coeliacs/or vegetarians/vegans",1
Lovely restaurant on rooftop and staff was very friendly.lovely food fantastic view.,2
Expensive but nice,1
"The staff were lovely and so helpful. The food was incredible and I asked for some specific requirements which were met with ease.
Thank you",2
Outstanding food and service. However The music was very loud so it wouldnât be a great relaxed vibe,2
"Our starters and mains were absolutely delicious, superb quality and beautifully presented. Generous portions. Service was warm and professional. Only slight negative was the cheese board that we shared for dessert- was a tad plain. Would definately go back and recommend!",2
"Great food, service was excellent. Busy lively venue.",2
We had a lovely time. Food was fab and timing was perfect between courses. It was my hubby's birthday and he got a lovely happy birthday message with his dessert.  Very impressed and happy with our night,2
Really lovely afternoon. Food was fabulous. Lovely relaxed vibe. Will be back.,2
"Food was lovely. However, we were there with our young baby and there were no changing facilities, so would be very slow to return as a result.",2
Beautiful restaurant with gorgeous decor.  There is nowhere in Galway like it!  Service was great and very prompt.  Our meal was very tasty and pretty good value for money.,2
"Fab food, fab venue, great location. Definitely recommend for a special occasion.",2
"Lovely food, polite and pleasant service   would definitely recommend this place.",2
The food was great and the service was really good I had a friend drop of flowers there to surprise my partner and they help with that very well just one issue that me and my partner noticed is that the waiters are too eager to take the order seem a little bit rushed but over all location and atmosphere was amazing.,2
"Food, drinks ad service were excellent. Amazing views too!",2
"Gorgeous venue, the food was beautiful and the staff were all lovely!",2
"Amazing set up, great views of the city. Outstanding food and lovely cocktails.
Will definitely return!!!",2
"This was my second visit to Sophie's and I really enjoyed the food and service but on this visit we were seated at a table that had a curtain behind one side of the seats and the view was completely obstructed. It was a special occasion and I was bragging about the view and my party couldn't see it. Get rid of the curtain. With the curtain, it just seemed like I was at a nice restaurant. The view really tops the experience off.",2
"Was a great meal, lovely restaurant. Felt as though we were rushed a little to make an order. 
Lovely touch at the end of the meal when dessert came out, they had âcongratsâ written on the plate as it was my graduation.",2
"Food very nice and good quality but very limited menu, no pizzas on menu like shown on there online menu. Service is very relaxed, over 30 mins for mains to arrive but thatâs part of there atmosphere they want you to enjoy surroundings and the beautiful cocktails. 
Waiting staff very knowledgeable on menu and great to give recommendations. 
Itâs a real treat! Definitely worth going to!",2
"Very enjoyable lunch. Food was excellent, great choice of wine and cocktails were fantastic. Had a lovely afternoon with friends. 
Will be back soon ;-)",2
"Positives: Lovely ambience, service staff are very friendly, food is delicious and wonderful views.

Negatives: food is very pricey so for us it's only a special occasion location which is a great option to have in Galway. Location is a little bit off the beaten track if you start your night on Quay Street so advise people to start in Sophies and then work your way down to the bars. Tables are a little bit too close together, could do with a small bit more room as we could hear the conversation beside us clearly.",2
"Great service, everyone is super polite and nice.
The food is delicious,and the place very  pleasant",2
Food was very good. I had the sea bream and it was cooked really well. Everyone else has steak and no complaints there,2
Had a beautiful meal and really appreciated that our desert plate for my daughter congratulated her on her graduation. Staff were very attentive,2
"Beautiful venue, food was excellent,  very relaxed ð no one was rushing us out. Andrew looked after us so well, we had lovely seating and service ran smoothly.",2
"Food was great!
Service was excellent and we were well looked after! 
Will be back for sure.",2
"I love the press group and its vibe, the Stella cinema is one of our most loved date nights however we were disappointed with this restaurant, the food was ok but nothing special and took 35mins to come out to us and we only ordered 2 main courses and 2 cocktails, we were also not checked on again to see would we like to order more drinks, was disappointing and was glad i had gift vouchers to pay as would have been annoyed to drop â¬100 for a very mediocre evening myself. Defo could have thought of better things to spend that â¬100 on at the moment.",0
"Took our cousins from New York for dinner on Sunday evening. They loved it, everything was spot on. The cocktails were amazing. Loved the whole experience, lovely waitress, food and loved our table. Keep doing what ye are doing it's top class",2
"Great food, lovely staff , tasty cocktails, comfortable seating. Perfect for a nice evening. I would highly recommend.",2
"Nice food, lovely staff. Special compliment to the portuguese waiter.",2
"Food was good, portion sizes on the small side. Tables max 8 inches apart, very cramped and almost like you were part of table to left and right. Told multiple times we had the table for 2 hours. After 1.5 hrs the bill was fired at us, without asking if we wanted coffee etc. You pay those prices for a dining experience and the experience was transactional at best",2
"Great place to celebrate special occasions. Beautiful food, friendly staff, fantastic atmosphere overall super interior designðð¼ð¸ð",2
"It would have been good if we didn't have to wait over 1hr for our food, which was good but still, we left frustrated. Management needs to tighten their act.

The wait was really long, when we flagged it up, the server went to enquire and came back telling us ""well you didn't order starters but the kitchen timed your mains as if you had"" - what an odd thing to say... After I asked, we got courtesy olives and bread. 

The staff seemed overall fairly junior, and not trained in actually keeping an eye on things rather than going through the motions of the service. This room is missing on some highly experienced old timers.

The food was good, just the menu felt all over the place, trying to be all things at once, without a clear direction on the cuisine. The Pizza oven wasn't working, which we weren't told of when we were passed the menus, and that may have created a mess as pizzas are low prep and all of a sudden they had way more prep-intensive plates to do. 

From pricing to the dishes, adding the service, even the diners were a baffling range of people, from 60 year old ladies in their evening outfit of sparkles and lace, to groups of 20 something, to visibly colleagues on an outing. 

Overall it feels like Sophie's really needs to stop trying to be everything somewhat, and pull itself together into a tighter act that makes more sense and delivers on promises. At the price point of the most expensive dishes, it falls well short of target. For the 14 euro pizza, would be strange yet ok. That should not be any restaurateur's target.",2
"Although it was a quite lunchtime service, when we were served our food one of main courses was delayed by about7mins,which is a little unprofessional considering the limited choices on offer,",0
Amazing food and fantastic service.,2
"We had a tasty brunch here, staff were really accommodating, interiors are gorgeous.",2
Food was very poor. Drinks were nice and really beautiful decor. Would only recommend for drinks,0
"The staff were incredibly friendly. A really lovely experience, thank you.",2
"I strongely reccomend it. Great place, with a fantastic service and food.",2
"Nice setting and pleasant staff.  However, food not great at Brunch.  Burger meat was very tough and made us think maybe it had been cooked previously and then reheated.   Not good value at â¬16.95 for an American burger.",0
"Food was good, but tables are extremely close to each other, couldn't hear my date talking to me. We have waited an hour for food. Nice views though.",1
"Great Food, great cocktails ! Lovely venue with amazing views. Highly recommend.",2
"A little disappointed to be honest. Venue looks amazing and I would say is good for drinks. Disappointed with the food. I got the buttermilk pancakes and they were not up to scratch. Didnât get the cream with them but when asked I got it. 
Thereâs a weird taste off the tap water too? 
Nothing that canât be fixed! I would go back again but for your own sake, more work needs to be done on the food.",0
"What a view!! We booked the table for  sunset and it was perfect. All the tables have a nice view and you can walk out to the terrace as well. 
The food was very good and the service was amazing!! Our waitress was very personable and we enjoyed sharing time with her throughout our dinner.",2
Service was fantastic and friendly all night. The setting and atmosphere was lovely.,2
Lovely place service was excellent. The food was nice but not spectacular for the price.,1
"Loved every minute.  Will be back soon. Lovely, friendly staff. Very welcoming.  Food and service excellent.",2
Disappointed with the food. Very expensive for what we got. I had tiger prawn linguine and I was very disappointed as there was no flavour to it at all. My 3 friends had the parmasan chicken linguine and they said it was very bland as well.,1
The waitress Hazel was very good! Food was lovely and well portioned. Good selection of champagne. Cocktail menu can be improved further. Starter portion are big and very filling! Great ambience and best view in galway city! Excellent service!,2
"Really lovely experience at Sophie's, ambiance and food was fantastic, service was personable and quick. I would definitely recommend it!",2
Had lunch here with my sister and aunt. Food was very good but portions small for the dishes we had. Service was excellent and we loved the ambience and the beautiful views from the terrace. Would not eat lunch here regularly but nice for a treat. Definitely a place to bring visitors to while in Galway.,2
"Very poor service.
Poor value for money.
Very limited options...pizzas totally off the menu!",0
Brilliant staff and gorgeous food! Would highly recommend,2
Excellent food and service. Beautiful surroundings and well looked after. Very enjoyable evening.,2
Lovely tasty food with picturesque views of galway.,2
"1st downfall-no options for pizza- broken oven apparently.
no poultry on the menu and poor gluten free options -1 option which was very tasty but for a party of 4 only one of us could order a meal for our dietary needs
cocktails have more egg white than anything else they need improvement.
really disappointing menu options but waitress was so helpful and nice",0
"Best Restaurant in Galway,its a different experience than any other Restaurant in Galway.",2
Fabulous place for Brunch with friends!,2
"Amazing venue, great waitress.
Food is good",2
"Overall fabulous experience, I really enjoyed the food and will definately be back.  My only issue was the noise level... too loud, especially music playing background.",2
Gorgeous in every way!,2
"From the minute we were greeted at the front door, every member of staff were fantastic! Friendly, enthusiastic and kind. The decor is outstanding and the food is absolutely amazing! We were waiting a little longer than expected for our meal but the drinks and view made up for it. Lovely touch in the ladies bathroom with the sanitary products available and the shelves behind the toilets in each cubicle ðð» perfect for a date night or girls night, canât wait to go back again",2
Went for early brunch.. was quite when we got there but started to fill as we left. Great atmosphere in a funky hotel. Great for all ages. Really enjoyed our birthday brunch,2
"Service was very slow, waited over 30mins for a drink.",2
"Great food and service, I would highly recommend and we will definitely be back",2
"Best food I have had out in a really long time, staff were great. The whole atmosphere was fabulous.",2
"Lovely staff and very attentive, food and menu could be better .",1
"Had to look for someone to order the second round of drinks, waiter had no clue of the menu, couldnât assist when asked how the pork was done.

Poor service overall",2
There was 5 of us all together and not one of us left unhappy! Food was fab and the service was great! The decor and atmosphere is lovely as well! I found the menu to be reasonably priced as the quality of the food was top notch! A great addition to the city of Galway! Will be back again!,2
Lovely restaurant very friendly Nd accommodating staff food was very good service was great. Felt really well looked after,2
"Food was 10/10, the duck was delicious and cooked perfectly! The manager at the door was an absolute gem, she made our night for sure!",2
Beautiful restaurant. Great setting and views.  Good and drinks fab.,2
Dinner menu very limited. Not a great selection of fish or vegetarian,1
Spohies at the Dean is a beautiful place. You can see a gorgeous view of Galway from the rooftop restaurant.  There are cute swings outside the door that make a great photo opportunity. The staff were friendly & the food was delicious. The coffee could of been hotter but other than that it was excellent. It opens at 7am for breakfast during the week which is great too. Its hard to find places opened that early. I'll definitely be going back for dinner sometime soon. I bet the lights of the city will look fab at night from there.,2
"Overall, brillant experience! Food and Staff were amazing, couldnât have a desert as I was so full but the cocktails went down a treat instead!! Highly recommend",2
"Excellent food, service and atmosphere. We will be back!",2
Had a lovely early birthday dinner and thanks for my birthday dessert even if the candle wouldn't light x,2
"Had a wonderful brunch there with my mum and daughter, food was tasty, staff couldnât have been nicer, ambiance was beautiful, will definitely be back ð¥",2

"We had a lovely evening in Sophieâs, the staff are absolutely exceptional and are definitely the best part of the restaurant. Unfortunately we found the food over priced for the quality. Basics seem to be a struggle e.g chips (which cost 4.50) coming out soggy and dripping in oil. âCrispy duckâ not being crispy due to sauce been smothered over it. If the price of the food was less, I think we would have given a hire rating but unfortunately when you pay over 15 euro each for a starter and 35 plus each for a main  you expect something exceptional which this meal wasnât. Again I cannot state enough how lovely the staff were and the restaurant itself is fab with lovely views. Buuut was it worth the price, no",0
"Booked lunch for my daughter and myself on her birthday. Iâd seen that the hotel was opening soon and I was really glad to find somewhere glam that was open for lunch - so many restaurants are only open for dinner at the moment.

Street parking was no bother, we were met on arrival at the restaurant and seated comfortably. All staff were equally professional, equally welcoming and equally well presented. There was a sense of something special about the place that the staff conveyed.

We were well looked after, I had a mocktail, my daughter a cocktail, then she had the chicken paternal and I had the tempura battered white fish. Both dishes really tasty and beautifully presented and perfectly seasoned. Asked if we wanted the dessert menu I said yes, of course, itâs my daughterâs birthday - sheâs 27 but was thrilled when they brought her dessert, sang her happy birthday and her dessert had happy birthday piped in chocolate.

The decor is an excellent balance between the masculine and feminine, it doesnât detract from the views but I imagine itâs a really beautifully cosy atmosphere at night with the city lights as a backdrop. Loved the chandeliers, the reeded glass partitions, the brass hardware. Particularly loved the support of artists and the great art choices in the restaurant lobby and the stairwell too.

My daughter will definitely be returning with friends, as will I. The affordable priced coffee in the lobby coffee shop didnât escape our attention either. 

The weather on the day was warm and humid and we found the air conditioning was a gentle balm that we didnât know we needed.

Iâll be going back regularly because it makes visiting Galway more of a comfortable experience.",2
"The pizza was terrible , it was floating in water would not get food there again as it is very overpriced. The cocktails however were gorgeous",0
"This place is cute and the food is very good. However, someone in our party canât eat pork and we ordered the Caesar salad. There was no note on the menu that this item contained meat or pork. We alerted the waiter and asked for a new one with no meat, and a new set of silverware. 

We actually stopped a waitress that wasnât our original waiter. I assumed she told him but we didnât see him after that incident until it was time to pay. He would walk by our table but wouldnât check in on us. It was pretty awkward. 

I would suggest if you have dietary restrictions or allergies to double check even if the menu doesnât list the items.",2
"Location on rooftop is stunning, decor is fabulous. Food is expensive, starter of goats cheese filo was delicious but main course of Iberico pork was very dry and lacked flavour I was expecting for the price. The potatoes were not flavoured with chorizo, rather bits were just used as a garnish, the spinach was cooked well but had no flavour or seasoning, overall it needed sauce as it was v dry. Tiramisu dessert was also unspectacular. The cocktails were good though. I felt it was a premium price for the view and not the food. Not sure I would return for food, maybe for a special cocktail to celebrate an event.",1
Food was awful. Very mediocre and uninteresting,0
We enjoyed our Food and cocktails but we were rushed out in the end. The pancakes were nice. The Rated R lemon cocktail was amazing. We arrived at 2pm and at 5pm we were told several times by a rude waitress  that we needed to leave as she needed ther table back. The whole place was empty bar 2 tables near the bar. We were just finishing our cocktails and were waiting on a lift. I am aware that the booking says table for 1 hour 45 or 2 hours but the table just needed to be set.,2
"Food was amazing, and fab drinks ð¥°ðð» will def be back",2
My 2nd visit to Sophieâs but this was disappointing. Had checked online before hand and lunch menu from 2.30. But no lunch menu available when we went. Brunch menu was all that was available on a Sunday afternoon minus the pizzas as the oven was out of order which left us with a very limited options! Not really good enough.,1
Really enjoyed our meal and the service was great. Asked for cocktails not on the menu and it was no problem at all. Lovely night.,2
"My wifeâs 49th birthday. Everything was spectacular. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and drinks. Thank you to the staff that made it possible. Hats off to you!

"What an experience! The food was amazing, the views were surreal and the service was excellent! When we had finished taking photos on the swings in the little lobby area and made our way in to the restaurant itself we were immediately greeted by friendly faces waiting to welcome us. The way my food was presented on the plate was like a work of art it was absolutely stunning. The duck was extremely tender and juicy but to my surprise was complimented very well by the cherry garnishes. I can't commend Steven enough for his hospitality and excellent service, his recommendations were on point with our hand crafted cocktails and our food. He left us wishing we had room for dessert but that's for another day! Can't wait to come back!",2
"The place is amazing and service and food is brilliant. The fact the pizza oven was not working was a little annoying, but we were told we'll in advance, which was very professional. The one issue was how compacted the tables were. It was very difficult to enjoy the meal and have a personal conversation when other couples were so close. But other than that the place is amazing and the food and staff were fantastic.",2
"Very disappointing food, great service and ambiance but food isn't up to scratch for the price",0
One waitress was not pleasant at all but apart from that was lovely.,2
"Fabulous decor ,  service really good staff very friendly and food was delicious.",2
"The waitress was the only good thing about our experience in Sophieâs, Galway. I brought my family there for my birthday. We booked a week in advance and it wasnât massively busy but we werenât given a very good table. 
When we ordered our drinks, one family member asked for a beer which we were told wasnât available. 
Then he ordered a starter and was later told they didnât have it. 
Another family member asked for a pizza, to be then told nearly 20 minutes later the pizza machine wasnât working. Sheâs a fussy eater which is why we chose Sophieâs as she loves pizza and this happened. They kept coming down to us offering different dishes to then tell us they werenât available. Eventually, she was offered a burger from the restaurant downstairs but the manager said âweâll sneak it up for youâ, making us feel it was a bit of an inconvenience, and Iâm sure she meant well. We arrived at 7:30pm and we didnât get our dinner served to us until 9pm. I canât eat late as Iâve low food tolerance which is why we went for 7:30pm so I ended up being up most of the night because I ate so late. The main waitress we had was just a joy and so nice, she was so apologetic and completely understood our frustrations and took accountability so we cannot fault her. However the overall experience was really bad considering theyâre a new restaurant. The lack of food or ability to make certain dishes on a busy enough Monday evening was very bad.",1
"Overall it was lovely and I would return. Food was very nice, could be hotter but was a very busy day and there may have been a delay somewhere. Most servers would go above and beyond, however one server was not happy to heat up a babies dinner.  I asked her what was I meant to do as my baby needed to eat, she did not offer any other solution... After requesting to speak to a manager, this was no problem and my baby had a lovely dinner also. There was no baby changing facilities",2
"Amazing experience!! Great food, waiters...just a little cold....",2
My friends and I had an amazing dinner; Cocktails and desserts also delicious.  Great service and friendly staff. I highly recommend this place.,2
Lovely atmosphere! Very friends staff and service was excellent. Food also arrived very quickly. We had a great time âºï¸,2
View amazing. Pizzas to die for. Wait staff fabulous. Very energetic with modern vibe. Good for all ages.,2
"Food was standard, atmosphere was lovely and lovely view.",0
"Pleasantly surprised by Sophieâs Galway. Great service, food & views. Cool addition to Galway dining scene! A big YES to try.",2
"Great decor, ambiance and views. Staff were amazing. Menu overpriced though.",2
"Nice environment, friendly helpful team. Food overall ok",2
A beautiful place with a stunning view of Galway. The food was really excellent and the staff were very pleasant and helpful. We will be back!,2
"Itâs a nice place to go sit, relax and have some food. The atmosphere is nice, the food is good, I wouldnât say fantastic only because Galway already has so much to offer when it comes to food.",2
Lovely Atmosphere and the staff were excellent. I would definitely recommend.,2
"Sophie's was very average in terms of food and very overpriced in my opinion, there are some fantastic restaurants in Galway with great food and at much better price point. The dean is lovely in terms of decor but I wouldn't be rushing back for the food.",0
Such fab meal- best steak and cocktails ever. Staff were fantastic so accommodating and friendly :) canât wait to go back,2
"Great views, lovely interior design, comfy seating and an outstanding breakfast! Would have given 5 stars for all categories but had to locate someone to bring the coffee we ordered but did not get with our meal and were delivered the wrong food fir one at our table. However, because the restaurant had recently just opened, we chalked up those minor glitches to âjust opened - staff still finding their feetâ so it was no biggie. Issues were sorted quickly and we continued to enjoy an exceptional breakfast. Will definitely return for dinner or drinks.",2
Pizza was good value and tasty. The steak was lovely but slightly over priced (â¬40). Staff were excellent but most of the food was brought out and one person was left 5 minutes for their pizza. I would come back again.,2
We booked lunch to be told at 2.30pm it was the brunch menu ! Then staff couldn't find key to get wine 20 mins later got wine!!! Staff dressed very casual not what we expected. Good like a burger house . Burger very dry and I normally would not eat.pizza but had no choice.  Disappointed! Was hoping for a new foodie place?  Don't go unless you like pizza and burgers,0
This is my second time at Sophies in Galway. Both times service has been excellent and food was lovely. Highly recommend,2
"Good food in a cool setting, staff were very welcoming",2
"Sophie's rooftop bar looks fabulousð. We had booked a regular table but when we got there we asked could we sit on the terrace instead and they accommodated us no problem. Staff were friendly but service was poor.  The waiter brought us some of our food and said he'd be back with the rest but we didn't have any cutlery. He came back a few minutes later with our fries and we had to ask again for some cutlery along with salt and ketchup. He came back a few minutes later with the ketchup then went off again and after a few more minutes we eventually got some cutlery. By that stage my husbands food was luke warm but mine was stone cold. We had waited so long for food I just ate it (took along time for staff to take our order, long time for food to come out) The food was delicious but cold. The restaurant wasn't too busy and there seemed to be plenty of staff so not sure what the issue is. Some items are pricey and some portions are small - we overheard the table beside us complaining about that so seems to be a general consensus. Overall we were disappointed with the service but we'd definitely go back for the food and atmosphere.",2
We were greeted on arrival very warmly and told Maryann would be looking after us. She was a really lovely friendly girl talked us through the menu and suggested a cocktail that matched my sons requestâ¦ The views were lovely and there was a lovely Sunday afternoon buzz about the place. We all had different dishes and all were deliciousâ¦ brownies were to die forâ¦ I would highly recommend,2
Food was good... were told on arrival we only had our table for an hour and a quarter which we weren't told at time of booking. Was ok on this occasion but may not have been.. food was lovely and service good. V hard to talk as music v loud,2
"Food was so underwhelming, chewy overdone pancakes with grapes and one blob of cream for â¬13, lovely staff but youâd make better pancakes yourself at home",0
"Greeted fine but then our server was slightly rude and didnât start our visit off great. Would definitely turn me off going there again. 
For what we payed on our visit I definitely think staff could look a little more professional in the way their dressed! 
Also there were empty seats and people were turned away. Itâs a long way to come to the bar and people be turned away.",0
Our experience was amazing from start to finish from once we entered  the resterant till we left the staff were amazing and courteous they were very knowledgeable and easy to approach the food was like nothing I have eat in  Galway before it was a special night it for us and because of the staff and the food it was an amazing night for us and because of everything we will be telling everyone to visit Sophie's in Galway at least once in their life because once you go once you can't wait to go back looking forward to my next meal somtime in the future.,2
"Amazing decor, food and service. Looking forward to going back again!",2
"Great and gorgeous place. I personally didnât like the way the hostess welcomed myself, when he saw i was in waiting for the table and he was just there to reception people, he turned his back straight away and took longer to talk to me, when we finish the food and we were chatting away, we took a bit longer to leave the table (there was plenty of empty table around us) and he was very upset walking around angry face, after a while he came to our table handled a bill that we didnât request, charged us 16 euros for a burger that we didnât have and said a bit aggressively that he need the table back by 9pm and walked away. We need to asked waitresses to check the bill again because it was clearly wrong She brought the correct one for us. We asked him to get us a table outside we wanted to see the sunset he said it was alright and he would come back to bring us to the table outside in 5 minutes, that didnât happen. Overall poor reception and welcoming.",2
"Prices are extortionate ye are a hotel in Galway not Dublin. 

â¬40 for a steak crazy.",0
"Great experience, lovely staff, delicious food and views.",2
"Mandatory tip 12%???? That's ridiculous! That is a robbery. 
And the pizza oven was broken...
And if you book for 10 you have to choose a 56 euros menu+12% tip...OMG
Still recommending it because the place is amazing, but check your bill, they include a bottle of wine we didn't drink!",2
The food was lovely and the views of Galway are great,2
"Really good food, friendly staff and overall enjoyable experience!! Looking forward to my next visit already",2
"Atmosphere was nice, the music was lovely. Food looked amazing but two of the dishes we ordered were cold and had to be sent back. The food did taste good and the butternut squash risotto was amazing. We were told at 2.50pm that the kitchen closed at 3pm and only served pizza thereafter. This was not mentioned at the time of booking nor is it on the menu. We had multiple different servers, one was extremely friendly and could answer all questions regarding the menu etc, one was very unfriendly and made it known that this job was a chore which put a bit of a dampener on the mood and chats we were having. I would go again and this time maybe sit outside on the terrace.",1
Stayed at the dean Hotel cork and had an idea what to expect. We had a reservation at the restaurant in Sophie and was excited cos knew what to expect. However was quickly disappointed the restaurant quite small not as big as I thought it be in Cork but I guess that's not their fault. We received menus but it took then 40 minutes before someone eventually came to take our drinks order followed by another 10 mins wait for food order. Food was amazing but my bacon and cheese croquettes was freezing it looked like it was left out for awhile now I didn't complain or return it and still ate it cos was yummy.  Once done then it took them another 30 mins wait for mains. We got our mains but nobody noticed we had no cutlery so we had to ask someone to give us cutlery. Once finished we asked for dessert menu we were 15 mins waiting no dessert menu and we decided then we would not stay any longer.  We asked for our bill but that took another 15 mins. The service was exceptionally slow. Now i know still be teething issues as they only happened 4 weeks but it seemed the basic staff training wasn't there. We told the manager and he apologised and acknowledged the issues there on the night and said that it wasn't acceptable but also it was busy time of our booking at 8.45 but still isn't acceptable excuse. I will come back cos I wanna give it another chance but lot of improvements to be made.,2
"Our first date night since our son was born & it was a fantastic choice of restaurant! The weather was fabulous so we asked to be seated outside in the sun & it was bliss! The food was amazing & the service efficient & professional & the staff were very friendly & accommodating! The atmosphere was energetic & the place was buzzing! Would highly recommend & will definitely be returning! Well done all! Warmest wishes, Anne & Danny âââââ",2
"Amazing.  Have a wonderful time @ Sophie's rooftop bar. Had the goats cheese to start and had the sirloin steak. And to finish with a glass of the house red wine. Superb, Serve was fantastic.  Can't wait to return",2
Me and my family went recently for lunch. The food was really good only a shame there is no kids menu. because I had young children with me and they had to order the burger and chips on the adults menu at a higher value. but apart from that overall very good. And lovely views of Galway City.,2
nice views and atmosphere just abit overpriced for what it is,1
Our fabulous server Rebecca looked after us all evening and made us feel most welcome . The pizzas were amazing as well as our starters which were a bit on the small side. The steak was good and the drinks were lovely.,2
"Lovely place, fab views. Service, food, and drinks were all very good. The menu is a little restricted for people who donât eat red meat..there was a fish dish, risotto and pizza options but no chicken dish. Dinner menu is also quite expensive but the overall experience was lovely. I would go back",2
"My wife and I had a date night at the Sophie's,  we had some wine, some cocktails and my wife and the duck and I had a pizza.  The food was awesome, the drinks served to an absolute perfection. But most of all we have to say our server Adriana was such an amazing person, so much knowledge of the wines, cocktails and food, she really went above and beyond to make our experience to be a memorable one. You should give this girl a rise and a promotion immediately. It is so rare to get staff like her! Love it, and we will be back for more grateness",2
"Staff very helpful, pleasant and welcoming. Always available to ask for help. Enjoyed the friendly atmosphere in the restaurant.",2
We had an amazing time at Sophies in the Dean Hotel Galway. Definitely coming back again. Wonderful experience :),2
"The atmosphere and dÃ©cor was great. We felt that the food options for lunch was slightly limited, it would have been nice to have one or two more options as it was a Sunday.
The food service was quite slow â we waited 45 minutes from ordering until our food arrived. 
The staff were all lovely; the cocktails were delicious.",1
"Superb from the moment we got there. Everything about Sophie's was top class. Great food, friendly and courteous staff made for a great dining experience. Definitely going back!!!!",2
"Fabulous food, great service and great views from the rooftop.",2
"Very poor service, had to request menu, waited 1 hour for food. Food OK but little over priced, service really impacted our experience",0
"Food was really bad 
Place is lovely",0
Fabulous restaurant but not much options to eat,0
"Really cool roof top restaurant and considering it had only been open for 2 weeks, the whole experience was pretty slick. Food was outstanding and the Iberico pork was next level good !! Decor is super stylish and the place has a great bustling vibe. Service was a little slow with some staff still finding their specific role within the restaurant service, but all were really polite and knowledgeable on the menu. We will definitely be back",2
"Really loved my food, it was unbelievably tasty! However, I couldn't get over how small my portion was for a main course. I ordered the duck, it was about 28 euro which is fine but I was actually hungry after I finished my food, they could definitely afford to add more potatoes to the plate!! I say I got 2 max 3 baby potatoes quartered.. cocktails were amazing",0
"New staff (-:,main course was disappointing. Could be excellent when fully up and running.",1
Just wonderful in everything.,2
"Very friendly staff, the food was delicious and the cocktails were beautiful.",2
"Food was very nice so fair play to the kitchen only criticism I would have is the portion size of veg with the duck but was still very tasty . The service was very poor 25 min waiting on just a glass of wine at the start and when asked for a second was told they would see as the bar was busy asked for a cocktail near end of the night instead of a desert and after waiting 30 min with no sign of it coming we decided to leave . When we arrived the security on the front door of the hotel was not very welcoming and would not let us passed unless we had a reservation. When we were paying a gentleman who can only assume was the general manager or owner said to us as we were going up il just try to get another member of staff who at the moment is having a nervous breakdown ,this is not something you say to a customer and I'm saying this as someone who has had 10 years experience in the industry . I can understand a new place can have teething problems but this was a let down",2
"Great cocktails and atmosphere, will definitely be back",2
"Fabulous experience 
Delicious meal
Excellent staff
Everyone agreed we will be back.",2
"Food and cocktails were phenomenal, will be back again. Hotel isn't quite finished yet, but the restaurant is gorgeous, and the views are great.",2
"Few teething problems, really think the place shouldn't be open for at least another 2 weeks.

Stunning decor, no doubt it will improve",1
Loved everything about Sophieâs. Will 100% be returning,2
"Food was not very good. 
Service was slow.
Would not recommend",0
"We had the loveliest server who couldn't have been more helpful. The charcuterie board was delish. The menu online had a few more options on it for main that weren't on the menu in the restaurant, which was slightly disappointing especially when there were only 5 options and 2 of which were steak.",2
